This evening's HDB Public Housing story comes via popular demand about the lonesome point block along Moulmein Road.

Block 69 Moulmein Road is, on first inspection, located very oddly at the junction of Moulmein Road and the turnoff from and to the Central Expressway (CTE) at Exit 7A.

It is unusual mainly because it stands alone amidst an area of private housing with the nearest clusters of public housing across the CTE at Rangoon and Cambridge Road.

However, this was not always the case because where the CTE now runs was once an estate of low rise Singapore Improvement Trust flats.

In fact, Block 69 Moulmein Road was the FIRST of a new typology of conventional point blocks that the HDB started building in the early 1970s that later came to dot our public housing landscape in every new town and HDB estate.

Completed in 1972 and balloted to the public on 7 January 1972, Block 69 received 700 applications to purchase 76 units of 4-Room flats.

Each flat was sold at S$15,500.00.

Block 69 remained in the news even later on in its life as in 1999, when the flats in Whampoa estate were due to undergo upgrading, it was apparently left out of the programme until residents petitioned the government and HDB to be included.

Apparently, despite undergoing two previous lift upgrading exercises, the lifts in Block 69 do not yet serve the top floor (level 20) but when I visited it recently, a third lift upgrading exercise is currently taking place and I hope that this time round, the lifts will go up to level 20.
