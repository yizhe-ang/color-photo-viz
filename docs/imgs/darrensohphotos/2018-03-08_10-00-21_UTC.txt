#modernism at stake. In the wake of the collective sale of #pearlbank #pearlbankapartments four other modernist megastructures in #singapore have begun #collectivesale proceedings. These are #peoplesparkcomplex #goldenmilecomplex #peoplesparkcentre and  #goldenmiletower. Designed by #gohhockguan it housed #singapore â€˜s largest cinema #goldentheatre when it opened in 1973. It is decided #brutalist in nature and is the only brutalist building of this massing left in the country. .
