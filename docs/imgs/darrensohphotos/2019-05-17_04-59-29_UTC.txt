Renowned Chinese American architect I.M. Pei has passed away on 15 May 2019.

Pei was 102 years old and lived an amazingly prolific life as an architect. He was known to be extremely sensitive to the sites upon which he built and here in Singapore, I.M. Pei built three (four if you include Suntec City which he worked on with @tsaomckown and @dparchitects) buildings which I will share today. The first and oldest of these is the OCBC Centre, conceived in 1969, with construction commencing in 1971 and completed in 1976.
