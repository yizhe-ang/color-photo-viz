The last (for now) but certainly not least HDB project reimagined with Kodachrome colours is Block 32 New Market Road, or as most of us know it as - People’s Park. Planned as the Park Road Redevelopment project by the HDB, People’s Park was the OG HDB mixed use project where a six storey residential slab block sits on top of a three storey commercial podium with shops and a massive massive hawker centre. Built in 1968, it was also the very first HDB project that incorporated a void deck, albeit not on the ground floor but at the podium roof on level 4.
