The next project reimagined in the 60s/70s look was actually built in 1973. It is none other than blocks 63-66 Yung Kuang Road, better known as the Diamond Blocks of Taman Jurong. The blocks were always rental blocks from the beginning, first built to house workers working in the Jurong Industrial Estate. They were not built by the HDB but the JTC and are unique because no other blocks like them exist anywhere else in Singapore. When the complex was announced, the JTC said that the blocks would sit atop a “shopping centre” below on the ground floor and is the only public housing estate in Singapore that encircles a Fairprice supermarket that remains till today.
