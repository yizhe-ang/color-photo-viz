This is Peninsula Plaza. Peninsula Plaza is a space most photographers in Singapore would be very familiar with due to the concentration of camera shops in it as well as in the nearby Excelsior and Peninsula Shopping Centres.

All three buildings were designed by Edward Wong of Alfred Wong Partnership and Peninsula Plaza was completed in 1980. The architecture is Neo-Gothic and AWP was inspired by the Neo-Gothic St. Andrewâ€™s Cathedral just next to it.

It boasts a double setback receding facade with a lower and upper podium followed by the tower.

Peninsula Plaza has recently undergone extensive renovations which removed all the iridescent brown mosaic tiles which were falling apart but thankfully the rest of the facade and its beautiful mosaic finishing were restored instead of bastardised.
