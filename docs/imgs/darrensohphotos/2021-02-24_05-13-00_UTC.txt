In the Northwestern corner of Yishun lies a very interesting precinct of HDB flats with a very pedestrian sounding name of blocks 115A, 115B and 115C Yishun Ring Road.

Located in Chong Pang next to the Nam Hong Siang Theon 南凤善堂 temple, these three blocks did not exist before 1999.

Comparatively, the rest of the HDB estate in Chong Pang dates back to as far as the late 1970s with most blocks built in the early to mid 1980s. 

The site on which they stand used to be an open field between blocks 107 and 114.

The three blocks were completed in December 1999 and hold a total of 177 4-room flats and 180 5-Room flats.

Very symmetrical and photogenic, the blocks have been photographed by many photographers before. The entire precinct also sits directly on top of a basement carpark with multiple staircases to the blocks' lift lobbies.

Between the blocks is a courtyard where many residents do their morning exercises and the occasional photographer comes to make a photo like this.

The MOST interesting thing about these three HDB blocks is that they were not designed or engineered by the HDB at all.

Instead, this project is a collaboration between the HDB and the @urasingapore where URA architects and engineers worked on the project FOR the HDB.

As far as I know, this is the ONLY HDB public housing precinct that is designed by architects from the URA.
