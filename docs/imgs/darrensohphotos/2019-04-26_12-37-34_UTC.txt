We’re back to regular programming but it feels as if the monsoon is either 4 months late or 7 months early zzzz so of course we make lemon juice when life gives you lemons or in my case, #puddlegram when life gives me puddles. This is the infamous #peoplesparkcomplex #rooftop #carpark that is almost always flooded even when there is the slightest of rain but you can imagine what it’s like now.

Also I dedicate this image to the memory of @otto_steinert Michael Wolf who passed away suddenly yesterday. He will be missed. .
