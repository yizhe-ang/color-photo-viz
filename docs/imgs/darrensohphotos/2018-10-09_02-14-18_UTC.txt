Yesterday evening’s #iphone Low light test made me really try and push the cameras on the new #iphonexsmax to its limit. This image of #peoplesparkcomplex #珍珠坊 was made using the telephoto 2x camera of the iPhone XS Max which has had no hardware changes from the camera on the iPhone X (only the wide angle camera received significant changes). Yet I was able to make a shot like this that i previously could not all thanks to the advanced computational improvements under the hood. .
