This is the #concourse one of #paulrudolph 's two large buildings in #singapore Completed in 1994, it was designed as a #commercial and #residential #mixeduse project with a #podium that would house the #condominium portion of the complex. The podium was completely demolished and rebuilt in the late 2000s and two towering condo blocks  designed by @coxarchitecture were completed in 2012. Interestingly, they rebuilt the signature #curtainwall of the podium block to Rudolph's design, perhaps as a nod to the master's legacy. üòùHere is a closeup of that curtain wall. #sgarchitecture #archivingsg #archdaily #architecture #architecturesg #architecturelovers #architecturephotography #architectureporn #sonya7rii #sonyalpha #sonyalphaprofessionals @paulrudolphfoundation @archdaily @dezeen
