These #blackandwhite apartments on Monk's Hill Road were built in the #1950s and #1960s by the #British to house civil servants working for the then colonial government in #Singapore. They aren't conserved but have been largely unembellished and are still used as residences today. #igsg #instagram_sg #archivingsg #sglandscape #sgarchitecture #archivingsg #archi #archilovers #architecture
