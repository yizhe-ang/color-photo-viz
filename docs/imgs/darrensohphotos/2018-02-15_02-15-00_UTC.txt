Images from my #archive of #pearlbankapartments #pearlbank It makes me immensely sad this Lunar New Year to be faced with news of its impending doom, and as Iâ€™ve always said, we cannot save every #building but there are some that we will feel the most #heartache for, and #photographs are a mere consolation and in time to come, a reminder that we could and should have done better. Until it is confirmed that it will definitely be demolished, I choose to remain hopeful.
