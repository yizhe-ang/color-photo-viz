What does Liang Court and Nippon Paint have in common?

Liang Court was developed by Wuthelam Group in collaboration with Daimaru Inc and completed in 1983 after substantial delays.

A piece of trivia on how Liang Court got its name. Wuthelam Group and Wuthelam Holdings was founded by Singapore billionaire Goh Cheng Liang, who at one point was the richest man in Singapore. Extremely low key by nature, Mr Goh and the Wuthelam Group happen to also be majority shareholders in Nippon Paint - which means that the Japanese paint company is largely Singaporean owned. 

Anyway, that is how Liang Court got its name - from Mr. Goh's name. And both Liang Court and Nippon Paint are linked through Mr. Goh with Japanese companies.

In 1999, Liang Court was sold to Pidemco Land which merged with DBS Land to form CapitaLand in October 2000 and today is one of Asia's largest real estate players. 

Liang Court will soon be demolished and redeveloped by its two co-owners Capitaland and City Developments Limited.

I am grateful to have had a chance to document the buildings extensively earlier this year.
