Of course I have to end off my three posts today with another perspective of I.M. Peiâ€™s #Gateway which I feel is his purest in form of all his buildings in Singapore. Completed in 1990, the pair of buildings bear more than a passing resemblance to his other mega project completed about the same time - the Bank of China Tower in Hong Kong. The Gateway is such an amazing building that up till today, people who have never seen it in person still refuse to believe it is actually three dimensional.
