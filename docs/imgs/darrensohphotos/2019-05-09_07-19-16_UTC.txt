One of the exercises we do as architectural photographers in order to keep ourselves on our toes and hopefully sharp is to try and photograph a building we have made thousands of images of previously in a way we haven’t yet done so. This morning I was in Bishan and took a walk around the #skyhabitat by @safdiearchitects a building I have photographed from construction till completion in 2015. I found that because the sun strikes it from the north east at this time of the year in the morning, I was able to make this image where it’s entire south facing facade is in deep shadow. .
