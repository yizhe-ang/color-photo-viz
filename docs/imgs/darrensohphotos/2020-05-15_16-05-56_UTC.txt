Once again I have been off Insta for a bit. Who knew being in a near lockdown could be so draining and exhausting in our bid to maintain some kind of sanity? In any case, like any responsible photographer I haven’t been out photographing much at all except on errand runs like this image I made of @funansg earlier this week when I had to send an ipad for repairs. The mall was completely deserted at 5pm mostly because it’s not located in the heartlands and not really in anyone’s close radius even for supermarketing. I feel I should be posting if only so we can one day look back on these strange strange times and remind ourselves of what transpired.
