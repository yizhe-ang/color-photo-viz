Blocks 1-7 Teck Whye Avenue #teckwhye have recently been painted in #pietmondrian #mondrian colours similar to a few blocks at #circuitroad and #balamroad in #MacPherson estate but there appears to be far more attention to subtle details here. I returned again to make more images in the morning when the sun hits different facades in the estate. The silhouette was a happy bonus. .
