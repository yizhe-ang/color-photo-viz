When the HDB was first formed in February 1960, it concentrated on building a very typical type of HDB block called the slab block. The slab block was so named because it looked like a slab sitting on the landscape and it came in a few variations. Some slab blocks were angled, while others were curved, but the majority were straight and well, looked like a slab. :) In 1970, the HDB started to introduce a new typology of HDB block called the Point Block. If you live in Singapore, you would have seen one of these at one point or another (pun intended hur hur), and you would be forgiven if you (like I did until a few years ago) assumed that all point blocks contained 5-Room HDB flats of 1 living room, 1 dining room and three bedrooms with 2 toilets and a kitchen. 
However, the first point blocks built in the style we are familiar with were blocks 26 and 28 Bendemeer Road pictured here. They were completed in 1970 BUT they did not contain five-room flats. Instead, each floor in the point block comprised of - get this - 3x 3-Room flats and 1x 4-Room flat. 
So while it is true that MOST HDB Point Blocks like the three in this image consisted of 5-Room flats, this is not true for all of them. .
