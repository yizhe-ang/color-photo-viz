This is Block 50 Havelock Road, which, on first glance, appears to be a regular HDB public housing slab block.

However, careful observers will notice that the first two floors of Block 50 are comprised of shops and not flats.

Block 50 was built in 1966 and this unassuming block has an important place in history for at least two very big reasons.

The term "hawker centre" was first coined by the HDB in 1966 when Block 50 was built as it was here that the HDB experimented with permanent hawker stalls within a HDB block for the very first time as reported in its 1966 Annual report on page 56 where there were "Cooked food stalls on ground floor and dry goods on first floor". One has to remember that in the 1960s, hawkers were viewed as a problem (and not national treasures like today) and the HDB tried to tackle this problem first by offering the hawkers "pitches" where they could come with their pushcarts to set up shop and then later in hawker centres where they would be fixed to one location instead of being itinerant.

Fast forward to 1974, and Block 50 made history again by being the location of the NTUC Cooperative's second ever supermarket. The first NTUC supermarket opened in July 1973 in Toa Payoh Central in its own building (Block 192 Toa Payoh Lorong 4) and Block 50 became the first ever HDB public housing block in Singapore to have a NTUC supermarket located on its ground level.
