This is the Thomson Nature Park, the site of a former Hainan village full of Durian and Rambutan Trees. The trails in the Park follows the roads of the former village and the park is also home to the endangered Raffles' Banded Langur.

Many of the tall trees in the park have immensely far reaching canopies and you can actually observe a phenomenon called Crown Shyness, where the leaves of the different branches maintain a distance from each other.
