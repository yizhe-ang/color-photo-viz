A #nocturnal #view of #thecolonnade on #grangeroad in #singapore The #colonnade was was one of #paulrudolph 's final masterpieces, four of which can be found in #southeastasia two here in #Sg and the other two in #indonesia #Developers in #asia allowed Rudolph to bring to life designs that were thought to be too dated in the #USA by the 1980s and 1990s but looking back, they are indeed beautiful. I count myself highly fortunate to have been granted access to photograph the Colonnade which really checks off a big item on my to do list. I find it unsurprising that the #swimmingpool was designed to #mirror the magnificent #facade of the #structure. #nightphotography #nocturnalwonderland #sgarchitecture #archivingsg #archdaily #architecture #architecturesg #architecturelovers #architecturephotography #architectureporn #sonya7rii #sonyalpha #sonyalphaprofessionals @paulrudolphfoundation @archdaily @dezeen
