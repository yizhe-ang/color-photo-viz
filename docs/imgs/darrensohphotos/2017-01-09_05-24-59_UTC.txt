#sunteccity was designed by #tsaoandmckown #architects to resemble a palm from the air with four #towers and a shorter block as the fingers and thumbs and a #fountain in the center of that palm. This #symmetrical view of the four towers was made from the #northeast and clearly shows the open #boulevard between the towers leading straight toward #marinasquare #architecture #tsaoandmckownarchitects #archdaily #sgarchitecture #architecturesg #urban #cityscape #architecturephotography #landscape #sglandscape #landscapesg #landscapephotography #singapore #archivingsg #dji #phantom4pro
