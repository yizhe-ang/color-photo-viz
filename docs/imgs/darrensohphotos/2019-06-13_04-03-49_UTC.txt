Originally completed in 1978, #deltasportscomplex was due for a complete rebuild from 1 June 2019 but it appears that the complex as well as the accompanying public swimming pool has had its life extended for a wee bit. Consider this spectator stand that had a full span cantilevered roof built without any columns on the front with all the stress distributed to columns at the rear.
