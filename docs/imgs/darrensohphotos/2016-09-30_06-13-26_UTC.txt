A rare straight on view of the @mandarinorchard along #orchardroad in #singapore a #landmark and #icon since the first tower (this view) was completed in 1971. The towers were designed by #stanleyleong and have undergone extensive renovations over the last four decades but the #facade remains largely unchanged which is a good thing really. #architect #architectureporn #archdaily #architecture #architecturephotography #architecturelovers #architecturesg #sgarchitecture #sonya7rii #sonyalphaprofessionals
