Thank you everyone who has come by to @objectifscentre for my talks and seminars and even just seeing the show - your presence all makes the work worthwhile. A special mention to my oldest buddies in photography @calebming and @theanimalbookco who came by last week. There are still upcoming sessions planned with both @cathayphoto and @sonysingapore so stay tuned and register for those if you wish to get a little more insight about how and why I do the work I do. Thanks everyone!!!
