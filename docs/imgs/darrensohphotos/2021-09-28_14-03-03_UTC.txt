Here is a wider (much wider) view of block 68 Toa Payoh Lorong 5. There used to be a huge mature tree that stood right in front of the block that would cast beautiful shadows on the block in the mornings but earlier this year, a storm uprooted the tree and it fell, leaving the block exposed for photography.

Built in 1966 as part of the first batch of flats completed in Toa Payoh, Block 68 is T-shaped and comprises 240 flats in total, with 11 3-room flats and 229 2-room flats.
