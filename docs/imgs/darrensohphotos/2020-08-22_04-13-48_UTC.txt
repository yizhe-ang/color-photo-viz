Some views of our HDB Public Housing estates and blocks are no longer possible due to demolition of the surrounding blocks around them or the build-up of newer and taller buildings around them.

In other cases, like this one, a pair of new buildings grants unprecedented views never ever before possible of a town so filled with historical significance in the public housing history of our country I could write an essay based on what can be seen in this view alone.

This is Lorong 5 Toa Payoh, the oldest part of the town that was the first to be completed in 1966 / 1967.

The famous Y-Shaped block in the foreground is block 53, a  one-of-a-kind 19-storey block that was the tallest block in Toa Payoh when it was completed in 1967. It was also used as the HDB's showcase VIP block with an Observation Deck built just below its iconic roof-top water tank.

In 1972, Queen Elizabeth II visited Singapore and was given a tour of Toa Payoh with a now famous visit to the roof of block 53.

Today, with the lift and municipal upgrading of the block, the rooftop is no longer accessible and a large part of the view from the observation deck obscured by lift motor rooms added during the upgrades. 

This view of block 53 was never possible until GEM Residences, a new condominium built in front of the block and was completed last year in 2019. I also used a 9mm rectilinear ultra wide-angle lens from Chinese lens maker Venus Optics to make this expansive view.
