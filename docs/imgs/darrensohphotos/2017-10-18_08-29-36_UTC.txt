The light has been fabulous yesterday and today and I’ve been trying to make up for lost time (and expected rainy weather in the coming days) so I’ve been shooting a lot. I made this shot of #coralsatkeppelbay @coralsatkeppelbay yesterday morning for a client and there was superb fluffy high clouds. Corals, like @reflectionsatkeppelbay is designed by @daniellibeskind @libeskindstudio and cascades toward the waterline as you can see here. #sgarchitecture #singaporearchitecture #archdaily #archivingsg #architecture #architecturesg #architecturelovers #architecturephotography #architectureporn #starchitect #daniellibeskind #studiolibeskind  #sonya7rii #sonyalpha #sonyalphaphotos #sonyalphaprofessionals #fullframefullon#panorama 002/003
