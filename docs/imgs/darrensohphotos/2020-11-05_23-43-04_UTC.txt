Not many people know this, but Selegie House was built in 1963 by the HDB but only sold to the sitting residents in 1972, nearly ten years after it was first completed. This is because the HDB only rented out flats in its early years and started to sell flats only in 1964 and so Selegie House was a rental only estate from 1963-1972.
