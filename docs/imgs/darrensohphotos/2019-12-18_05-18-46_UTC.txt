In the early 2000s, the Housing Development Board started to "think big" and many of the projects completed between 2000 - 2005 were of the super-tall variety since they had to maximise the plot on which these new precincts would be built.

Of course, there is always a height limit in many areas because of the airbases and airports (we have 4 of the former and 2 of the latter on this tiny island) but where they could, the HDB built tall.

In Bukit Panjang, the tallest HDB flats tower up to 30 storeys in height like these six blocks at Senja Road. Collectively they are known as Senja Grand, and well, the name is somewhat befitting since they are pretty massive when viewed together and they are also perched on top of one of the higher ridges in Bukit Panjang.

Completed between 2002 and 2003, all six blocks are 30 floors in height, and each block has a mix of 4-room and 5-room flats. All in all there are 741 4-room units and 660 5-room units in this precinct. The six blocks surround a fairly large communal green space / neighbourhood park / playground where residents can gather and the outward facing units have pretty good views of the surroundings.

I made this image before the monsoon arrived when we could still depend on some sun and I remember trying to find the exact center point in between the six blocks in the neighbourhood park in order to make this "look up" photo.
