Many have asked what Tim had for breakfast when we hosted him this morning and the answer is - Chwee Kueh (we were in Tiong Bahru after all), Soya-bean milk, white fried (chinese) carrot cake and he also tried a selection of Nyonya kuehs for dessert. It was awesome to have the CEO of Apple dine with us here in Singapore this morning in Tiong Bahru Market. #Apple #timcook #tiongbahru #singapore
