Last year, as part of my exhibition and book launch of the same name, I coproduced a short documentary titled #beforeitallgoes with @ieremv and the folks from @runandgunsg in an attempt to go more in-depth into the issue of collective sales of private estates and also #hdb #publichousing redevelopment. We found out that far from being a matter of right or wrong, good or bad, it was in fact a confluence of many circumstances that is leading to the loss of Singaporeâ€™s older buildings. Here is a trailer from the documentary, where we spoke to photographer Sit Weng San, who grew up living in Pearl Bank Apartments. Link to the full documentary is in my bio. Have a look. .
