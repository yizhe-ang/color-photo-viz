I’ve been away from Instagram for a few months due to commitments elsewhere but I’m back with these three images of Singapore’s newest skyscraper! 

Formerly the Golden Shoe Carpark, this is Capitaspring by @capitaland designed by @big_builds @bjarkeingels and @crassociati together with @rspdesigners 

Boasting a terribly auspicious address of 88 Market Street, other photographers have already photographed it as it nears completion and here is my take on it.
