#BeforeItAllGoes will be my first show where splashes of colour will play an important part in helping the audience identify and place the sites I will be showing. Today I will share three examples of three different colour schemes we are using - of three sites that are sadly no longer with us or in the process of getting demolished. This is #buonavistaswimmingpool that was demolished in 2014.
