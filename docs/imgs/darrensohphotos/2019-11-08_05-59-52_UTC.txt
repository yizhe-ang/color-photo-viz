Did you know that besides being an oasis for wildlife such as the grey heron and home to a multitude of fish species, the Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park is also engineered for flood prevention downstream of the Kallang River? When the park was revamped in 2012, the concrete banks of the stretch of the Kallang River that ran through the park was completely redesigned to its current form mimicking an actual river with a flood plain that is meant to deal with the intense amount of runoff experienced during rainstorms. Iâ€™m excited to announce that I am working with @pubsingapore on the #MyTakeOnWater Photo Challenge where YOU are invited to take part in this challenge by tagging #MyTakeOnWater in a post where you interpret what water means to you here in Singapore and stand a chance to win attractive prizes! More info can be found in the link in my bio.
