It is the final night of the Hungry Ghost Month in the lunar calendar and it is believed that tonight, the wandering souls who roam the land for the duration of the 7th Lunar Month will now return to the Netherworld. Devotees gather in Lim Chu Kang Cemetery for a sendoff and the lanes in the cemetery are strewn with paper money that is offered to the departed. A bonfire is then lit, and the sendoff is complete. .
