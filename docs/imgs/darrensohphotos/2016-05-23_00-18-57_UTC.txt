Last night's #electricalstorm over #singapore was something I've been waiting years to photograph. We have one of the highest incidents of #lightning in the world and this does show it. It's a layered composite of 12 images made from one vantage point over an hour to show the number of strikes. #landscapephotography #landscape_lovers #landscapes #publichousing #hdb #landscape #sonya7rii #sonyalphaprofessionals #igsg #sg #sgig #stormchasing #stormchaser #stormchasers
