In celebration of the @natmuseum_sg â€˜s opening of their @polaroid exhibition #inaninstantatnms that will run till March 31 2019, I am posting three images today made during the 2011 General Elections Rallies in #singapore made on #type669 #polariod film, the very last batch of Polaroid film I had in my possession. These images were made at the @papsingapore lunchtime rally in the #cbd .
