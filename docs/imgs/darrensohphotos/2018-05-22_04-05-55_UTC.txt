I’m really happy to announce that in conjunction with @objectifscentre , I will be presenting my next exhibition and book on 21st August 2018.

Both the show and the book will share the same name: 
Before It All Goes | Architecture from Singapore’s Early Independence Years

Set against the backdrop of this year’s En bloc fever where many privately held buildings are trying for collective sale as well as the nation’s largest Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS) to ever take place at Tanglin Halt estate, it is my hope that my images can help start a debate and conversation on how significant many buildings from our early independence years of the 1960s - 1970s are. 
While we cannot save and conserve all our modernist buildings, we can educate the younger generation and the public at large on what we are potentially losing. 
The exhibition and show will feature the following 8 sites:

1. Pearl Bank Apartments
2. People’s Park Complex
3. Golden Mile Tower
4. Golden Mile Complex
5. Rochor Centre
6. Queenstown Cinema and Bowl
7. Tanglin Halt estate
8. Buona Vista / Bedok Swimming Complexes

Some of the sites have already been demolished and so all we have left are really just photographs and memories. Others like Rochor Centre are currently being dismantled as I type this and the big four all of course all threatened with an uncertain future because of En bloc collective sales. 
I’m very honoured to be able to work with Objectifs again for this, and also @abigaeltay and her team at #obllique that will be designing the exhibition space and @randy__yeo of @practice.theory that will be designing the book. In addition, I will also be producing a short video exploring the idea of collective sales here in Singapore with @ieremv and his team at @runandgunsg 
Of course, I will need to raise a significant amount of funds to make this happen, so I am hoping for everyone’s support in all ways big or small when I start the fundraiser later this week. 
Thank you everyone!
