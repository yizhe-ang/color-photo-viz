This is block 58 #commonwealthdrive, one of 20 #publichousing #hdb blocks that will be demolished come #2020 when replacement flats are built for residents. Some residents are happy to have their leases reset but most feel a sense of loss having lived for decades in their own neighborhoods. #architecturephotography #bird #silhouette #landscapephotography #nophotoshop #tanglinhalt #queenstown #shotoniphone6s
