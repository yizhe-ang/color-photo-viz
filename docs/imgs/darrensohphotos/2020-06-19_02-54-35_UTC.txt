Back in action! Singapore enters Phase II of Post Circuit Breaker this COVID19 season and as all retail open today as well as social gatherings of up to 5 pax became permissible, please remember we aren’t yet out of the woods. We may now move about and photograph freely but let’s just say the past 10 weeks has been something to “reflect” on. Stay safe, mask up and remain antisocial as you go make photographs!
