The @apple iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro series have landed!

I’ve had the chance to use mine for the past three days taking full advantage of this amazing weather we’ve had here in Singapore to push the iPhones to their limit. The new iPhones all have improved cameras and it really shows in the images I have made. 

This is an image of block 82 Commonwealth Close, which counts itself among the very first batch of HDB flats sold to the public in 1964. I lived there from 1976 till 1981 and go back to make images of it whenever I have a new camera.

This was made on the iPhone 13 Pro Max’s brand new Ultra Wide Angle camera which has a) a bigger aperture of f1.8 compared to f2.4 of previous generations’ b) a larger sensor AND c) autofocus!
