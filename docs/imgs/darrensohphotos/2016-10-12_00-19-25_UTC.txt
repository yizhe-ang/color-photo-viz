For the month of October, the #singaporegeneralhospital museum will have its iconic clock tower lit in pink every evening in support of #breastcancer awareness month 2016. I made this image last night with the #singapore #skyline in the background of the hospital. #breastcancerawareness #pinktober #sglandscape #landscape_sg #landscapephotography #cityscape #architecture #architecturephotography #sgarchitecture #architecturesg #sonya7rii #sonyalphaprofessionals
