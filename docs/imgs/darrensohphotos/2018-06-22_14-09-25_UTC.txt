A recent UN study declared that by 2050, 68% of the world’s population will be living in #urban areas, and a large proportion of these urban areas will be in #Asia . 
A large city takes on a life of its own, draws you in like a moth to a flame or repels you as if you and it were opposing poles of a magnet. 
For me, cities are magnificent studies of #architecture and #urbanism - both planned and organic in nature, and a testament to the human spirit as well as unexpected and unintended consequences of densely packing so many people together. 
Anyways, this is not #HongKong but instead #Taipei where I am currently for a short break. This image was made from the Observation Deck of #taipei101 .
