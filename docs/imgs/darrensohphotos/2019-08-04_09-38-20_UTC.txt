It’s that time of the year again for overt shows of patriotism and in some estates like Selegie House, the resident committee never takes chances and instead just puts up the flags themselves rather than wait for residents to do it. It’s proven to be a hit with Photographers who go there to photograph it every year and this year is the first year the flats have on their new paint job as the backdrop for the flags.

I will be sharing my photography documenting Singapore and the concept of home for Today At Apple on 10 August 2019, 1600hrs - 1800hrs. Sign up link in my bio.
