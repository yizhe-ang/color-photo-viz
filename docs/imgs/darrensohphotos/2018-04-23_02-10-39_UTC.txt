Hidden in a corner near #newtonhawkercentre at #monkshillterrace and #windstedtroad are five blocks of old #apartments originally built in the mid 1950s by the #singaporeimprovementtrust #SIT the predecessor to the #HDB They are extremely important buildings in #singapore â€˜s building history because once upon a time there used to be many like them around the central area of the island and they have mostly been torn down. They were one of the last SIT projects before the Trust was dissolved in 1959 and the HDB formed in 1960. .
