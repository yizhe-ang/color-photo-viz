Block 26 Jalan Klinik in Bukit Ho Swee is one of only about 10 blocks left in Singapore with a completely grilled parapet wall along all itâ€™s common corridors. Here I used the wide angle (26mm) camera of the iPhone 11 Pro Max with the Halide app shooting in manual mode with a selected shutter speed of 1/2 Sec at ISO 32 the lowest possible ISO setting of this camera.
