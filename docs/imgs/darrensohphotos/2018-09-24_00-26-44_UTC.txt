This is #waterloocentre completed some 32 years ago in 1986 by the #HDB It is one of several #mixeduse complexes consisting of a podium of shops which are then sat on by 3-5 blocks of #publichousing built in The Central district of #singapore #rochorcentre was one of these as well and is being demolished right now. I made this image yesterday when I was leading a photo walk and teaching an architectural workshop with @sonysingapore @sonysdwsg and @objectifscentre as part of #BeforeItAllGoes .
