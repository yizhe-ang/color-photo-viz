Today’s three images will be a series of  #blastfromthepast photos made of the #construction of #megastructure projects here in #singapore that I’ve had the privilege of documenting over the years. Today’s last structure has become an icon of #kentridge since it was completed in 2013, the #interlace by @capitaland and designed by @buroolescheeren. Engineering by @arupgroup and built by @wohhupgroup .
