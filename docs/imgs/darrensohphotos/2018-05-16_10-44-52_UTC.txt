I have not always been a fan of vernacular modernism. In fact when I started photographing buildings, I went for the bright, shiny and obvious like everyone else. As age caught up with me, I learnt to appreciate the honesty and functionality of a time past, and my obsession with the endangered ordinary began. This is the #ceiling of #joochiatcomplex at #geylangserai in #singapore a ceiling obviously inspired by Islamic forms and colours.
