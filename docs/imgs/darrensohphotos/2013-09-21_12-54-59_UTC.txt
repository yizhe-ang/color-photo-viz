I'm staying home this weekend but I've just realised this is the 6th year the F1 will be held in Singapore. Six years of traffic inconveniences! Wow. Anyways, to all of you out there, I hope you're having fun. This is an image from the track made in 2008 when it all began. #singtelgp #f1 #formulaone #sgmemory #singapore #architecture #urbanism #cityscape #landscape #urbanliving #singaporelandscape #singaporearchitecture #sgbuilding #sgarchitecture #sglandscape
