I am certain there are numerous #buildings on Instagram designed by #alfredwong of #alfredwongpartnership but there are almost no hashtags that could lead a casual researcher to his work. One of #singapore 's most important #architect s in the #postwar era, some of Alfred Wong and his firm's projects include #peninsulaplaza #furamahotel along #havelockroad the now demolished #nationaltheatre and #singaporepolytechnic @singaporepoly built in 1979 and shown in these images. One of the defining features of his SP project were these yellow #modernist #canopies that served to shelter walkways throughout the #polytechnic Over the years many of the covers have been repurposed but I believe some still stand in their original locations. #sgarchitecture #singaporearchitecture #archdaily #archivingsg #architecture #architecturesg #architecturelovers #architecturephotography #architectureporn #singaporearchitect
