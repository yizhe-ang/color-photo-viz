These two #watermelon slices are located in #Tampines near the new @ourtampineshub and are the last of its kind in #singapore another pair used to exist at #pipitroad but they are now gone. Interestingly this playground is a part of the Tampines Heritage Trail, which of course adds a whole new layer of meaning on their continued existence.
