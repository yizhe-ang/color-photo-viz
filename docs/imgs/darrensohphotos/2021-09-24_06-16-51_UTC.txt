The @apple iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro series have landed!

I’ve had the chance to use mine for the past three days taking full advantage of this amazing weather we’ve had here in Singapore to push the iPhones to their limit. The new iPhones all have improved cameras and it really shows in the images I have made. 

This is an image of a part of the Singapore CBD cityscape skyline made yesterday evening just before the sun set, on one of the evenings where the setting sun was not obscured by low clouds at the horizon.

This was made on the iPhone 13 Pro Max’s new 3x Telephoto camera giving an equivalent of a 77mm telephoto lens’ coverage, a focal length never before available on any iPhone. Really loving the compressed Field Of View.
