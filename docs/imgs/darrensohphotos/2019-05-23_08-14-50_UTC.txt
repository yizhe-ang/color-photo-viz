This morning’s contrasty light partially lighting the clock tower of the #telokayermarket #laupasat built in 1894 and one of South East Asia’s oldest pieces of Victorian era architecture. Lau Pa Sat literally translates to Old Market in colloquial Hokkien with the words Pa Sat borrowed from the Bahasa Melayu word Pasar which of course means market as well. The structure is a #nationalmonument of #singapore
