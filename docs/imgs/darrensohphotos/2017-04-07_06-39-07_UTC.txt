#singapore has always been sold as a #gardencity and while it sure is a great #tagline sometimes we begin to ask ourselves if we are really more #garden or #city The Island is tiny, and with a large #population much of the gardens we have are really transplanted from somewhere else. Here, a worker waters newly planted #trees and #plants in a #constructionsite at @marinabaysg In the background you see the new #skyscrapers that adorns the skyline including @fosterandpartners ' #southbeach and also @buroolescheeren 's @duo.official other landmarks like @esplanadesingapore and #marinasquare are also visible. #architecturelovers #archdaily #archivingsg #architecturephotography #architecturesg #sgarchitecture #urbanliving #cbd
