No post on People’s Park Complex can be complete without a night view of that awesomely organically evolved facade with hundreds of different window grille designs and a multitude of aircon condensers. I made this image from People’s Park (the HDB one) using the telephoto 2x virtual camera of the iPhone 14 Pro Max in Night Mode which works like a charm.
