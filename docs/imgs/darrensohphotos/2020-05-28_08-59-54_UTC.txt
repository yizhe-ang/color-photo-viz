Because we are still in the circuit breaker and should not be deliberately out photographing, I am going into my archives to share some fun facts about our public housing estates here in Singapore for my next few posts.

Precinct North One

Precinct North One was one of two large scale urban redevelopment precincts drawn up by the HDB with the assistance of Norwegian architect and planner Erik Lorange who was seconded by the United Nations to help with Singapore's urban redevelopment in the 1960s.

Today, the precinct is known as the Beach Road / Crawford area and the HDB flats that were constructed there between 1968 and the early 1980s are all still standing.

This is block 18 Jalan Sultan, one of two identical 2-Room rental blocks facing each other (the other being block 19). Both blocks consist of 150 2-Room flats spread out over 16 storeys with 10 units a floor.

Both blocks were completed in 1974 and were built to rehouse squatters and tenants from the shophouses in the Rochor / Crawford district that were demolished. In 1974, the monthly rent for a 2-Room flat was SGD 55

I happened to speak to an original tenant of one of these flats sometime in 2018 and the aunty told me that they were still paying a very subsidised rate of under SGD 200 a month for rent. She had originally lived in a shophouse across the road where Crawford Lane is today and moved into her flat at block 19 sometime in 1975/76 when she was resettled. She also said that some original tenants had secretly sublet the units to foreigners at much higher rates and were caught. If you were caught, the HDB would revoke your tenancy of the unit.

The 300 2-Room flats in these two blocks have never been sold to the public since they were built 46 years ago and remain as rental flats today.
