At the corner of Tampines Ave 1 and Ave 8 is a precinct of 6 public housing blocks built between 1995 and 1996 that show just how experimental the HDB was with concrete forms and facades in the 1990s.

All six blocks in the precinct share a U-shape block design and four of the six blocks (892, 892A, 893, 893A) consist ONLY of executive maisonettes and single-storey executive flats.

Pictured here are blocks 892A and 893, where a circular staircore has been employed on both blocks to connect the single-storey executive flats closer to the center of the image in 16-storey stacks to 12-storey executive maisonette stacks.

The precinct was featured in the March 1996 Issue of Houseword - the HDB's in-house newsletter for employees. There, we learn that the precinct's design was the work of HDB executive architect Lee Lian Hai.

We also learn that the balconies of the Executive Maisonettes which you can see on the right and left side of this image "have been designed with a very gentle curve such that they protrude only slightly from the facade."

Apparently this curve in the balcony facade as well as the circular staircores  were inspired by the waves of the nearby Bedok Reservoir.

All executive maisonette balconies are also joined vertically along the height of the facade with a circular column that "serves as an 'anchor' for the curved balconies on both of its sides, as though holding them in place."

Other design elements include the use of square nibs as a border around the casement windows of every unit in other to further give the facade a three-dimensional feel.
