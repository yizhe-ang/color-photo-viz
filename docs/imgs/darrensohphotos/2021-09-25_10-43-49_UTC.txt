I made over 2500 images in the course of 48 hours with the iPhone 13 Pro Max because the weather was so good from Wednesday evening till yesterday.

Also, shooting on iPhone is liberating because you learn to let go of much of the technical bits of photography and just trust the cameras to do their thing.

And do their thing they did! The Ultra Wide Angle camera with an equivalent 13mm coverage that I used for this shot now comes with a faster f1.8 aperture compared to f2.4 in previous iPhones and it even auto focuses and has a macro mode.

The subjects are blocks 81, 82 and 83 MacPherson Lane, 3 public housing blocks off MacPherson Road here in Singapore that will soon be demolished as part of the Housing Development Boardâ€™s Selective Enbloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS). The blocks were built in 1968 and were the last of the first phase of public housing built by the HDB in that area to be completed. The external semi circular staircases on all three blocks are unique to these blocks and once they are demolished they will be gone forever.
