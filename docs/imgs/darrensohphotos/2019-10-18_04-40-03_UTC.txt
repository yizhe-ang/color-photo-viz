Once the tallest blocks of flats in Toa Payoh Central, blocks 175, 179 (in this photo), 191 and 193 are four point blocks located in the area commonly known just as Toa Payoh Central where the HDB Hub and bus interchange as well as the library are located.

This area is bounded by Toa Payoh Central (the road), and Toa Payoh Lorongs 2, 4 and 6.

These four point blocks were completed just before the 7th Southeast Asian Peninsular (SEAP) Games that were held from 1-7 September 1973. It was the very first time Singapore would be hosting a major international sporting meet and the four blocks served as housing for the athletes.

Comprising a total of 384 4-Room units, (4 units per floor, 24 floors per block, 4 blocks in total) the units were all fully furnished in mosaic or parquet and could each house 6 persons.

After the Games, the blocks were balloted to the public at a much higher rate than a usual 4-Room flat because of all the furnishings and owners were even not allowed to renovate their units for three years after moving in so as not to inconvenience their neighbours.
