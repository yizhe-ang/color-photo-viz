Now how about the Ultra Wide Angle camera? In the iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max, it too has gotten a “turbo boost” in terms of features and now has a larger aperture opening of f1.8 compared to f2.4 in previous iterations. Remember Night Mode only came to the UWA camera last year and there were still some kinks to be ironed out. The quality is still not up to par as that of the Wide Angle camera when it comes to Night Mode and shooting in the dark, but it is already so much better than last year.
