Formerly known just as Marina Bay, Marina Reservoir is Singapore’s 15th reservoir and the only one that is located in the city center, south east of the CBD. Dammed off from the sea by the Marina Barrage, the Marina Reservoir has a catchment area of some 10,000 hectares and started operations on 20 November 2010. The Marina Barrage was completed in 31 October 2008 and desalting of the Bay began in April 2009. I’m excited to announce that I am working with @pubsingapore on the #MyTakeOnWater Photo Challenge where YOU are invited to take part in this challenge by tagging #MyTakeOnWater in a post where you interpret what water means to you here in Singapore and stand a chance to win attractive prizes! More info can be found in the link in my bio.
