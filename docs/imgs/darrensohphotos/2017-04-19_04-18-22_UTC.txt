I've seen this #tree at #marinabaymrt station grow over the last 30 years and the #mrt #station change names over the years and #buildings sprout up all around it as well as see an #expressway demolished behind it. Today it still stands and provides shade for whoever wants to seek shelter under it from the tropical sun. It is usually a #migrantworker from the neighbouring #construction sites such as the @marina.one.official site in the background that I am documenting for work. #archivingsg #archdaily #architecture #architecturesg #architecturelovers #architecturephotography #cbd #urbanliving #landscapesg #landscapephotography #sglandscape #shotoniphone7plus #iphoneonly
