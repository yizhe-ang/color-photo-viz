Same same but actually very different. A view of Block 29 Toa Payoh Lorong 5 I made just a few days ago in the same spirit of my last image made of 19 Jalan Sultan. 

29 Toa Payoh Lorong 5 shares some similarities with 19 Jalan Sultan in the sense that it also consists of 2-Room rental flats administered by the HDBâ€™s Public Rental Scheme. Consisting of 196 units spread over 11 floors, Block 29 was built five years earlier than Block 19 in 1969, making it 53 years old this year. Unlike Block 19, Block 29 has dwelling units on the ground floor as do almost all blocks of flats in Toa Payoh built in the 1960s. Also unlike Jalan Sultan, this block will soon be redeveloped with its tenants offered alternative housing in other rental blocks and estates.
