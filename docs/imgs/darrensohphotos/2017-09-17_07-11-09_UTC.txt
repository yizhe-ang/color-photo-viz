There is something very satisfying about photographing completely #symmetrical #buildings with the #symmetry going beyond the #facade and into the interiors. This is #268orchardroad an often overlooked and unnoticed building sandwiched between #theheeren and @appleorchardroad in #singapore designed by #raymondwooandassociates which consist of three glass boxes on top of each other, each smaller than the one below and sitting back further. The glass boxes are held up by #cables instead of #columns #singaporearchitect #sgarchitecture #singaporearchitecture #archdaily #archivingsg #architecture #architecturesg #architecturelovers #architecturephotography #architectureporn #sonya7rii #sonyalpha #sonyalphaprofessionals
