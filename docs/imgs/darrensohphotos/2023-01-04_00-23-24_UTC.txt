When I made this photo of ships firing off their flares at the stroke of midnight on 1st January 2020, I didn’t yet know it would probably be the very last time I would make a photo like this.

A maritime tradition for as long as I can remember, it is now unfortunately an offence to fire off flares in the sea around Singapore except in cases of emergency. 

While I understand the rational behind this legislation that is now actively enforced, I wonder if an exception can be made for just a small window of a few minutes every year on New Year’s Day. 

I will be sharing here three images I’ve made in the last decade of this practice. Remember not to take anything for granted and photograph everything; you never know when it would be the last time you can do so.
