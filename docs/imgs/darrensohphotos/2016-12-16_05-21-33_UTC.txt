An uncommonly (ultra wide) view of blocks 63-66 #yungkuangroad in @tamanjurong The four blocks are known collectively as the #diamondblock because of its shape when viewed from above (or below). Originally built by the @jtc_sg the flats were later managed by the #hdb and more recently have been used as #rental units. #publichousing #vernacular #architecture #architecturephotography #archdaily #architecturelovers #architectureporn #sgarchitecture #architecturesg #archivingsg #igsg #sgig #sonya7rii #sonyalphaprofessionals
