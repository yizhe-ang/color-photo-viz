Designed by @rogersstirkharbour, the new state-of-the-art home of The Macallan has found its place amongst the iconic conservatories at @gardensbythebay – an interesting juxtapose of its build in Speyside, Scotland. Made in celebration of The Macallan’s distinct mastery of craftsmanship and artistry is the Edition No. 4 – a single malt reflective of the brand’s uncompromising passion towards pushing the boundaries of excellence.
