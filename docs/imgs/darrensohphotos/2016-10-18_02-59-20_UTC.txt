Today I'm on assignment for a long time client of mine who were the family who built #cliffordpier so I got to visit this beautiful #artdeco building again. Much has changed since it was last used as a pier and today it's part of the @fullertonbayhotel and @thefullertonheritage collection. Kudos have to be given to the hotel because full access is given to members of the public who wish to walk around and view this amazing structure from #singapore 's past. #heritage #archivingsg #architecture #archdaily #architecturelovers #architectureporn #igsg #architecturephotography #shotoniphone #shotoniphone7plus
