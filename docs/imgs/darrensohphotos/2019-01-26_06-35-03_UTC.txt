Some of the largest HDB Public Housing flats ever built were Executive Maisonettes. They were all double storey duplex flats that had similar interior layouts but distinctly different balconies depending on which estate they were located in. They were all built in the 1980s before the HDB introduced the Executive Condominium scheme and many of them existed in former HUDC (Housing and Urban Development Company) estates. The HUDC was set up within the HDB to cater to a growing middle class in 1974 and ceased operations in 1987. This is Block 724, Yishun St 71 and it was completed in 1986. .
