Little India is filled with vibrant colours that represent its rich culture and heritage. Besides Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple on Serangoon Road, one of the oldest temples in Singapore that was built in 1881, you can also explore Shree Lakshminarayan Temple, Singapore’s first dedicated place of worship for Northern Indian Hindus.
 
Some other buildings that caught my eye over the years are two historical churches – Kampong Kapor Methodist Church and Church of the True Light. Not forgetting the Abdul Gafoor Mosque and the eclectic exterior of Sakya Muni Buddha Gaya Temple. All these buildings add unexpectedly to the vibrant facade of Little India.
 
Take a look at all the spots I have rediscovered over at @STB_SG, and share your own pictures with #SingapoRediscovers.
