Here we go! Breaking with tradition, I am sharing three time-lapse videos instead of three images #shotoniPhone12 and #shotoniPhone12Pro I made over the course of the last five days as I put both phones through their paces. My first impressions - they are stunning image and video making devices and once 5G is more mature, it will make sharing, sending and showing those images and videos all that much faster!
