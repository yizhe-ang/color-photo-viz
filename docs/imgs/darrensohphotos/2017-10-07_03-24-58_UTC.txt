I've use the #iphone to make #panoramic #images for as long as the phone was able to do so and have seen every version of the iphone improve on its imaging capabilities over the years. The newest #iphone8 allows you to shoot #panoramas to a maximum size of 63 megapixels but it is its control of the exposure that really blows me away. I made this image #shotoniphone a couple of days ago showing the #singapore #skyline toward #marinabaysg @marinabaysg and was amazed by how the phone managed to handle the huge contrast in lighting. #sgarchitecture #singaporearchitecture #archdaily #archivingsg #architecture #architecturesg #architecturelovers #architecturephotography #architectureporn #sglandscape #landscapesg #landscapelovers #landscapephotography #cityscape #panorama 003/003
