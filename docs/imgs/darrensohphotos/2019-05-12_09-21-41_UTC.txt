There are but a handful of truly unique one-of-a-kind Housing & Development Board Public Housing blocks in Singapore because a typology that works is usually repeated for efficiency and economies of scale.

Up till the early 1970s, straight or right-angled slab blocks dominated the public housing landscape in Singapore with only a few variations.

As the HDB moved into its third Five Year Plan from 1971 onwards, they started to introduce somewhat more interesting block designs. The ones which were more successful and well received have gone on to become typologies of their own - but a few have remained un-replicated.

A few of these blocks can be found in Queenstown neighbourhood VI (or the Mei Ling Street / Stirling Road area) where it comes as close as it gets to a living breathing public housing museum.

This is block 168A Queensway, or more commonly known as the Butterfly Block, so named because of its double curve facade emanating from the central lift core.

Inaugurated in October 1973 with a lease starting from 1974, it was Singapore's first double curve public housing block. There are a total of 228 second generation 4-Room (Improved) units in Block 168A. .
