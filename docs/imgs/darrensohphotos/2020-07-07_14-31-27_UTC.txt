I have had the privilege of testing Sony’s brand new SEL1224GM 12-24mm 2.8 GM Zoom lens that has just been announced for the last three weeks and have photographed with it here in Singapore excessively at f2.8 with amazing results.

This is an image of Dawson HDB estate shot at the lens’ 12mm end wide open at f2.8.
