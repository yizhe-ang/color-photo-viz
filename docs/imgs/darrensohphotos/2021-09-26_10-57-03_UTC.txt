What happens when light levels drop further and night descends on the city? Will the iPhone 13 Pro still hold its own? This image of the Singapore skyline made with Night Mode and shot in ProRAW surprised even me. I came into this armed with knowledge that yes the new sensor in the Wide Angle camera is supposed to work better in low light, but this was truly beyond what I had expected.
