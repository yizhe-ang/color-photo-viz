I recently posted a shot of this exact view at block 64 #toapayoh Lorong 5, right next to the famous #hawkercentre at block 75. made this image nearly 8 years ago in 2010, and decided to revisit it again last week to make this new image. The #led lights are new and it appears the tree has grown somewhat.
