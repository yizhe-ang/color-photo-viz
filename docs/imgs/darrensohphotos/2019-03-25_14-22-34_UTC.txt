Block 18 Jalan Sultan is a rental #HDB block that was completed together with its sister block, block 19, in 1978. They have been rental only right from the beginning up till today and were offered to residents uprooted from the redevelopment of Kampung Rochor when the HDB embarked on a massive demolition, resettlement and building project for Precinct North 1 that was bounded by Victoria Street, Beach Road, Ophir Road and the Sungei Rochor in the 1970s. Original resettled residents who still live in these flats still only pay a rent of less than SGD 150 for their 3-room flats, a rate impossible to believe today. .
