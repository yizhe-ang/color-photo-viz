I'm here in #nuremberg for a couple of days and took time this morning to visit the #dokumentationszentrum #reichsparteitagsgel√§nde which was a former #nazi rally ground and the largest #thirdreich #architectural #structure still standing in the world. It looks like the #romancolosseum but was built in the #1930s #architecture #architect #architecturelovers #history #historicalarchitecture #worldwar2 #archdaily #sonyalphaprofessionals #sonyphotokina2016 #sonya7rii #voigtlander #voigtlander10mm
