I photographed the #architecture of the @nationalgallerysingapore for the gallery over a period of three years from 2014-2016 and this has to be the image I am most proud of. It required a #cherrypicker and the stitching of some 13 individual photos made with the #Canon #canon17tse #tse17mm #tiltshift #lens in order to achieve this full frontal image. The image has seen been used in multiple places and most #media stories on the gallery and I'm really happy to have been able to make  the image. The Gallery's restoration work was carried out by #takenaka and designed by @studiomilou  #sgarchitecture #singaporearchitecture #archdaily #archivingsg #architecture #architecturesg #architecturelovers #architecturephotography #architectureporn #panorama 001/006
