Today, 12 October 2022 is the 20th birthday of @esplanadesingapore Officially opened on 12 October 2002, I had the privilege of making this photograph (shot on film using my Hasselblad 503Cw no less) from the Swissotel directly across from it in the days leading up to its opening. Back then, @marinabaysg was still a real Bay as there was no Marina Barrage and as you can see, there was also no @marinabaysands nor @gardensbythebay yet. Happy 20th Birthday Esplanade - Theatres on the Bay!
