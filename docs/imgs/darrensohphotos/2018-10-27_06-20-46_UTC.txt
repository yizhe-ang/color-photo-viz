The is the Beach Road, Crawford HDB estate off Jalan Sultan, formerly known as HDB Precinct North 1, and before that, Kampong Rochor. Bounded by the Rochor River in the North East, this area is set to change dramatically in the coming years. I first made images of this view a few years ago, then returned to make this panorama last week. You can see both Golden Mile Tower and Golden Mile Complex in the top right as well as the Singapore Sports Hub and the Indoor Stadium.
