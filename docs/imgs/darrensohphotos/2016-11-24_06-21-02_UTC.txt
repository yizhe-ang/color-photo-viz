This has got to be the most instagrammed (seldom used) #badmintoncourt in #singapore and probably also the highest elevated one, located at level 37 on top of #internationalplaza while this view has been photographed quite a lot, I've yet to see a completely #topdown #flat shot so I decided to give it a try. #architecture #architecturephotography #archdaily #architecturelovers #architecturesg #sgarchitecture #archivingsg #modernism #atrium #cityliving #urbanism #sonya7rii #sonyalphaprofessionals
