Today’s three images will be a series of  #blastfromthepast photos made of the #construction of #megastructure projects here in #singapore that I’ve had the privilege of documenting over the years. Starting off with this, an image of the #cloudforest at @gardensbythebay made in 2011 a year before the Gardens opened. #gardensbythebay is designed by @wilkinsoneyre and #grantassociates with engineering by @arupgroup and built by @wohhupgroup
