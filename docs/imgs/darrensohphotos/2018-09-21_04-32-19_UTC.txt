Portrait mode on the new #iPhoneXSMax allows you to adjust the #bokeh after the shot as seen in these three images which I set to f16, f5.6 and f1.4 respectively. Before you tell me that some Android phones could already do this two years ago, I ask you to try it for yourself and consider how well it has been implemented here as compared to on Android. .
