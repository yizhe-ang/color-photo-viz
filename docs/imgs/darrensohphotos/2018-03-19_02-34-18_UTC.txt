I photographed #bukittimahshoppingcentre five years ago when it was still this colour when the #downtownline #mrt #construction was still in full swing. Bukit Timah Shopping Centre is designed by #cheesoonwah from #cheesoonwahcharteredarchitects and he also designed the now demolished #queenstowncinema and the #textilecentre on Jalan Sultan all here in #singapore. .
