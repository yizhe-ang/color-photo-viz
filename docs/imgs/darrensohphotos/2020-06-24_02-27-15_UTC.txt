Parliament has been dissolved and Singapore’s 14th General Elections GE2020 will be held on 10 July 2020. Because of the COVID19 Pandemic, there will be no physical rallies of any sort this year - a first for elections in Singapore. Here’s an image made on the final night of rallies during the last general elections in 2015, of the @wpsgp Workers’ Party Rally for East Coast GRC held at Bedok Stadium on the 9th of September 2015. We may never see crowds of this size ever again.
