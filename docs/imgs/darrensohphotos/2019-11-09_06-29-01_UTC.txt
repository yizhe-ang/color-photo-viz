Originally named the Kalang River Reservoir, Peirce Reservoir was Singapore’s second reservoir (after MacRitchie) and created in 1910. In 1922, it was renamed Peirce Reservoir after Robert Peirce who served as Singapore’s Municipal Engineer from 1901 to 1916. The Upper Peirce Reservoir was then formed in 1975 after the upper reaches of the Peirce was further dammed. Located right inside The Central Catchment Area, the Upper Peirce Reservoir Park is a tranquil and secluded locale, a great place to escape to from the hustle and bustle of the city. I’m excited to announce that I am working with @pubsingapore on the #MyTakeOnWater Photo Challenge where YOU are invited to take part in this challenge by tagging #MyTakeOnWater in a post where you interpret what water means to you here in Singapore and stand a chance to win attractive prizes! More info can be found in the link in my bio.
