When you build a structure this size in a historical precinct, opinions on it are bound to be divided. Some people will love it and others will absolutely abhor it.

But I believe one of the many purposes of architecture is to spark debate. While I feel there isn’t going to be a clear cut answer on whether it is a beautiful building or not, the new State Courts Tower has already made its mark and is on its way to becoming an icon that will join other icons along the Eu Tong Sen Street / New Bridge Road corridor.

I for one am a fan of its pure form as seen from the East and West elevations, there is something absolute about that massing - no half measures here.

We have a Singlish saying - want to do, do all the way, and here I believe that @chrislee.serie has gone all the way with this structure that the judiciary will be very proud of.

The new State Courts Tower is designed by Serie Architects with Multiply Architects. Executive Architects are CPG Consultants.

In front of the State Courts from this perspective lies Alfred Wong’s Furama City Centre that is currently undergoing extensive A&A work now.
