An explosion of pastels surround a large rounded concrete staircase at #deltasportscomplex that was probably built to clear crowds quickly from the viewing gallery of the complexâ€™s multipurpose sports hall. As I have previously mentioned, Delta Sports Complex was supposed to undergo a complete rebuild from 1 June 2019 but this appears to have been postponed and the entire complex is still very much in use. Completed in 1978, this is one of the few remaining sports infrastructure projects standing from the 1970s.
