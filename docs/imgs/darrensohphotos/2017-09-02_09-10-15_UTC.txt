#Peninsulaplaza is another #masterpiece by #alfredwongpartnership that is often overlooked but sits right in the heart of our #cbd and frequented by lots of #Photographers because most of #singapore 's #pro #photostore s like @cathayphoto are located in the building or in the neighbouring ones. Built in 1980, #alfredwong was apparently inspired by the #gothic #architecture of #standrewscathedral across the road. #sgarchitecture #singaporearchitecture #archdaily #archivingsg #architecturesg #architecturelovers #architecturephotography #architectureporn #sonya7rii #sonyalpha #sonyalphaprofessionals
