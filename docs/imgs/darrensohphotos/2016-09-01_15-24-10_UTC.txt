If you take the #downtownline #mrt and happen to get on or off at #hillview #station you may have noticed a huge image of this view adorning the entrance. Several years ago I was commissioned by the @ltasg to produce a site specific artwork for the station and I chose to photograph the old #ktm #railway #bridge as it was a historical landmark that spoke about #railtravel and #singapore so I chose it as my subject. Tonight I revisited the site and made this image of the exact same bridge. #nightphotography #nocturnal #sglandscape #landscapesg #railwayphotography #landscapephotography #blastfromthepast #sonyalphaprofessionals #sonya7rii
