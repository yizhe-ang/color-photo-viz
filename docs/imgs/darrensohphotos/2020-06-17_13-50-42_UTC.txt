Market segmentation and product differentiation can be a strange and mind boggling thing - just look at offerings from Audi and BMW and you’ll know what I mean.

In 1974, the Singapore government launched the Housing and Urban Development Company (HUDC) - its task - to provide middle income citizens who could not qualify for HDB flats but for whom private properties were still out of reach an alternative form of housing.

HUDC flats were of the same size or larger than the largest HDB flats but cost more and were supposedly better built.

Initially they were in high demand but as their resale prices steeply increased in the 1980s, many residents decided to “go private” instead because the difference in pricing was not very much at all.

Eventually the HUDC scheme was discontinued in 1987 and the government later passed a law that allowed HUDC estates to privatise - doubling or tripling their values on the collective sale market, leading to many of them being sold and quickly demolished, their sites redeveloped into condominiums.

This is Hougang N7 HUDC estate, completed in 1986 at the height of waning demand for HUDC flats. Supposedly “Spanish-inspired” because of the liberal use of arches and semi-circular motives, it was privatised in 2014 and renamed Florence Regency. It was then sold collectively to a private developer in 2017 netting every owner over 1.8 million dollars for a unit that cost no more than 300k when bought new in 1984.

Florence Regency was demolished in 2019 and is currently being redeveloped.
