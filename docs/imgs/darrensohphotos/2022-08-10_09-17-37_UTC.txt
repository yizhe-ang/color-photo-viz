Yesterday, on 9 August 2022, the Padang became Singapore's 75th National Monument. 

With this gazette, it joins its storied neighbours like the Victoria Memorial Hall (completed more or less to this current form in 1906), the former City Hall (1929) and the former Supreme Court (1939) in the league of the most protected spaces and structures in Singapore.

This was a photo I made the day after Singapore's 25th National Day, on 10 August 1990, from what was then the Westin but today the Swissotel. I was 14 and could hardly tell an f-stop from a bus stop but I managed this. 

You can see all the National Monuments I mentioned in this image and more. Singapore has changed so much in the last 32 years that I could write an essay based on this photo alone.
