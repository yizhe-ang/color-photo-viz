I took a two and a half week break away from @jewelchangiairport because I was there almost every day during the preview and opening days but there was one phenomenon that I really wanted to photograph that I couldn't do during the preview days because of the timing. .
.
At 0900hrs every morning, if the sky is clear, there will be a stream of sunlight coming through the dome towards the HSBC Rain Vortex causing a scattering of rays thanks to the mist churned up by the cascading water. This lasts for about an hour till 1000hrs and if the weather remains good, it repeats again in the afternoon from the opposite direction at 1600hrs. .
.
I had already managed to catch the afternoon version of this and really wanted to do the morning one (where there would be less of a crowd as well) and I finally shot a series of images on the Monday that just past.
