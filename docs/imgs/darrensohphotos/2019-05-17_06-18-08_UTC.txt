Renowned Chinese American architect I.M. Pei has passed away on 15 May 2019.
.

Pei was 102 years old and lived an amazingly prolific life as an architect. He was known to be extremely sensitive to the sites upon which he built and here in Singapore, I.M. Pei built three (four if you include Suntec City which he worked on with @tsaomckown and @dparchitects) buildings which I will share today. This is @rafflescitysg by @dbsbank land now @capitaland Completed in 1986, Raffles City was Singaporeâ€™s largest commercial mixed use building and paved the way for all megamalls to come under the Raffles City branding.
