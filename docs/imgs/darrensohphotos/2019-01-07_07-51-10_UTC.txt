In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the #HDB and #PWD of #singapore like many other developers the world over, started to build buildings and structures in a distinctly #postmodern #POMO style after decades of #modernism receded from #architecture This is #choachukangbusinterchange completed in 1990 and open to the public in March 1990. Adorned with concrete formed motifs, the bus interchange is one of very few in Singapore that have seen little change in its form over the last 29 years. It served its last passenger on 15 December and will soon be demolished for works on the new Jurong Regional MRT Line. .
