Completed in 1978 as part of the @urasingapore ‘s redevelopment of precinct N1 also known as Kampong Rochor, Sultan Plaza was designed by Chee Soon Wah who also designed the Textile Centre next to it. He is probably best known for being the architect of the now demolished Queenstown Cinema and Bowl.

Recently put on the collective sale market with a reserve price of 380 million dollars, there hasn’t yet been any news if any developer has bought it since the open tender closed in the end of March.

With so many new developments launching this year, it may very well have missed the boat having come on the market as everyone is already ploughing their war chests back into the market.

Who knows?
