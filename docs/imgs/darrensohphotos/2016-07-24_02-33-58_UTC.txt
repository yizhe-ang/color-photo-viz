The first shots of last night's #fireworks display at #nationaldayparade #ndp51 preview as seen from #geylang #simsavenue I wanted to get the #singapore #skyline in the background of the image because it would provide context for the image but I also needed to get the first few shots because the smoke would obscure my view after. #sglandscape #landscapephotography #landscape #cityscape #ssh #singaporesportshub #ndp2016 #nocturnal #nightphotography #igsg #sgig #nofilter #oneshot #sonyalphaprofessionals #sonya7rii
