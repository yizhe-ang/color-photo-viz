Completed in 1999, Ang Mo Kio AutoPoint was Singapore's FIRST high-rise motor workshop complex. Prior to 1999, motor workshops mostly occupied single-storey terraces, some of which still exist today.

Purpose built by the Housing and Development Board of Singapore as an industrial building that catered solely to motor repair works, the complex is built in the architectural style of Structural Expressionism or High-tech Architecture as it is sometimes called. This style of architecture eschews hiding the services of a building and instead brings them all to the forefront, hence the obvious columns and maintenance gangways visible in this image.

Famous examples of High-tech Architecture include the Centre Pompidou in Paris, Lloydâ€™s Building in London and the HSBC Building in Hong Kong.

The architect for Ang Mo Kio AutoPoint was CESMA Pte Ltd, a wholly owned company of the HDB which it used mainly to consult and build overseas projects in the region. Besides designing Ang Mo Kio AutoPoint, CESMA was also responsible for some of the most intricate HDB Public Housing designs from the 1990s.
