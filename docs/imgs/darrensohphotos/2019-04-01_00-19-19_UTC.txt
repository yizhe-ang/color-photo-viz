I was back in #surabaya #indonesia over the weekend and of course I had to make new photos again of the #intilandtower #intilandtowersurabaya by @theinnovatie one of #paulrudolph 's two buildings in the country. Completed in 1997, it was actually only finished after Rudolph's death and he never got to see it. .
