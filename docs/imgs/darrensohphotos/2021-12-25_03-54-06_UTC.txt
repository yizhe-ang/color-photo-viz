Blessed and Merry Christmas to one and all. 

May 2022 be kinder to all of us. 

This is a collage I reimagined of Golden Mile Complex, made from an image of the building I made some years back sitting in my archives; I hope it will inspire us all to "reimagine" how an old building like this can be adaptively reused after it is conserved and saved from destruction.
