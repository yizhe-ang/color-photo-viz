For those of you who have tried to make a #symmetrical image of the #publichousing #flats in #tamanjurong known locally as the #diamondblock will know how difficult it is. The 4 blocks - 63 to 66 #yungkuangroad have lift shafts where the central points of the building are. This is the only building in #singapore designed this way. With some #shiftlens magic, some semblance of #symmetry can be achieved. #archilovers #archi #architect #archivingsg #architecture #architectureporn #architecturephotography #sgarchitecture #architecturesg #sonyalpha7rii #sonyalphaprofessionals
