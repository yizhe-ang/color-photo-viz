A big congratulations to @woha_architects for winning Building of the Year 2018 at this year’s @worldarchfest a real coup indeed! Previous winners of the top prize at the WAF from Singapore were all designed in collaboration with foreign architects and this is really the FIRST time a local firm has won Building of the Year! The icing on the cake has to be that the building is a mix-used public housing complex located in the heartlands, not a fancy commercial project in the CBD. Congratulations once again to WOHA and the HDB. I’m proud to have made these images for both of them. .
