Dappled morning light falls on #pinnacleatduxton as seen from #honglimcomplex last Saturday morning. Inspired by #thematrix pinnacle is designed by #arcstudio from #singapore and is to date, still the densest #publichousing #hdb estate in the country with each tower reaching over 40 floors in height. It was also the first HDB estate with a publicly accessible #roofgarden spanning the entire top of the development. #architecture #architecturelovers #architecturephotography #sgarchitecture #architecturesg #chinatown #igsg #archivingsg #cityscape #cbd #urbanism #cityliving #iphoneonly #shotoniphone7plus
