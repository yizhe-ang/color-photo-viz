Block 1 Queen’s Road (left) was Singapore’s first ever block of 5-Room flats. Introduced in 1971 and ready in 1973, a 5-Room flat here would have cost you S$ 33,000 at launch. About 1300 sq ft in size, these flats were only sold to members of the public whose family income fell between a very narrow bracket of $1201 - $1500 a month YET they were oversubscribed and extremely well received. .
