We've had spurts of great #weather interspaced with entire days of #thunderstorm in this #monsoon season so we do what we can while the light is out. I made this image while on the way home, it's a place I have to drive past everyday, so I'll always look out if there's an image to be made. This #angler is trying his luck in the waters of #lowerseletarreservoir #sglandscape #landscapesg #nature #singapore #landscapephotography #silhoutte #fishing #clouds #cloudporn #iphoneonly #shotoniphone7plus #archivingsg #igsg
