Somewhere in the far north of #singapore is #Sembawang #hdb #publichousing estate which is generally quite unremarkable save for a few #designs unseen anywhere else in the country. These ones are located at #sembawangway and #admiraltydrive and have a very #modernist vibe to them even though they were completed in the early 2000s. #modernism #sgarchitecture #singaporearchitecture #archdaily #archivingsg #architecture #architecturesg #architecturelovers #architecturephotography #architectureporn
