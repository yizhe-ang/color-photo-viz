Apple is opening its third store here in Singapore really soon at Marina Bay Sands and since the official announcement last Monday, photographers have flocked to the Bay to photograph the mysterious sphere on the Bay that has now been emblazoned with the Apple logo.

I wasnâ€™t really keen on shooting a view that everyone already has and so I had this image planned. However, it could only work if the MBS broadwalk was wet so I had to time the image to be made just after a storm. Thankfully we live in Singapore and it rains all the time so I got my shot this past weekend shot on iPhone in Night Mode.
