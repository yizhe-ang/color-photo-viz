In 2017, I made another image of Block 19 Jalan Sultan, this time with a new paint scheme on its facade and with a newer camera (the Sony A7RII). Block 19 was built nearly 50 years ago in 1974 and is a HDB rental block under the Public Rental Housing scheme right from the beginning. Constructed at around the same time as other blocks in Crawford, the block consists of 150 2-room flats spread over 15 of the blockâ€™s 16 storeys. Block 18 that faces it is identical in all ways.
