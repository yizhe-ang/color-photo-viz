In a dense city state like Singapore, it is really hard to find areas untouched by human intervention no matter where you go. I explored this more in the sequel to While You Were Sleeping - titled In The Still Of The Night and published in 2015.

Some of the things I actively sought out while working on the project were alien looking structures with an otherworldly feel made even stranger when photographed at night. These are two gigantic water tanks along Old Tampines Road. They resemble spacecraft even in the day and by night look like they are about to blast off.

While You Were Sleeping - The Documentary directed by @ieremv premieres tomorrow 31 March on the @objectifscentre YouTube channel at 2100hrs. Do join us!
