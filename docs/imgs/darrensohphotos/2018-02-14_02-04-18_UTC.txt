Yesterday we received news that the iconic #pearlbankapartments #pearlbank had been sold to @capitaland for some 728 million SGD, and it has been announced that the new development will have 800 units of unblocked views. There has been no word on whether any part of the original building by #tanchengsiong will be conserved, but things arenâ€™t looking hopeful right now. One can still hope though.
