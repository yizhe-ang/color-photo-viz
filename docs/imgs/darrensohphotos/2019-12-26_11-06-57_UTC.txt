Bear with me as I share my version of what must be the umpteenth photo you will see of this afternoon’s annular solar eclipse as viewed from Singapore at 1324hrs. This image was made on my @sony A7Riii with a SEL200600G 200-600mm zoom lens with a 1.4x teleconverter attached to give a 840mm reach. You can see at the bottom left of the eclipse a phenomenon known as Baily’s beads, where the topography of the moon obscures the light coming from the sun at some points as it moves across the outer edge of the sun.
