It’s Christmas! 2021 has not been any easier than 2020 but here we are. The year has been filled with challenge after challenge but there has been many rainbows as well after the storms. It’s nice to welcome Christmas this year with another literal rainbow, courtesy of @verysmallexhibition whom I have been following. Am so happy to have managed to make this image of his work tonight at Canberra in Sembawang (not just because it’s 3 mins from where I stay). Check out his feed to find out more about the work he does! Merry Christmas everyone!
