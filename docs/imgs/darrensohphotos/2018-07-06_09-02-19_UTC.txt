Hereâ€™s another #throwback post of an image all the way back 2006, on the day where the #nationalstadium in #Kallang #singapore was officially closed. It hung on for another good two years before its eventual demolition though, but I was glad to have documented it while it still stood. And in 4x5 #largeformat to boot!
