This is the very last #dragonplayground left in #singapore still left in its original sandpit. It has been appropriated for all sorts of purposes - the backdrop of politiciansâ€™ photo shoots, the venue for a heritage fest, but what does built heritage actually mean?

These are some questions we should really be asking ourselves this National Day, as the country turns 53, and we are still losing old buildings and places at a shockingly frightening rate.
