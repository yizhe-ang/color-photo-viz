When I first made this photo from the #marinabayfinancialdistrict in 2007 over ten years ago, I never thought I’d be revisiting it and scrutinising it to such detail ten years later. The #singapore #skyline has changed so much you’d be hard pressed to recognise where this image was made from. To put things in perspective, that building under construction on the right is #thesailatmarinabay which at that time was the ONLY building in the new Marina Bay financial district. You can clearly see #SGX centre 1 on the left which has been almost completely hidden from sight today. Yet to be built in this image - #asiasquare #marinabayfinancialcentre #marinabaysuites and of course @marina.one.official which will officially open today.
