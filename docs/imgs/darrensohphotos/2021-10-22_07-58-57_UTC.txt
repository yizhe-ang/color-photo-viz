This is the Thomson Nature Park, the site of a former Hainan village full of Durian and Rambutan Trees. The trails in the Park follows the roads of the former village and the park is also home to the endangered Raffles' Banded Langur.

If you go to the park in the mornings, you can sometimes get amazing rays of sunlight pouring through the canopy of the tress as seen there.
