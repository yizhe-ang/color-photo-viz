Built  in 1964, the three 16 storey HDB slab blocks on top of the hill in Queenstown at Commonwealth Close earned the nickname of “chup lak lau” which in Hokkien simply meant 16-storey home. Blocks 81, 82 (pictured) and 83 were the first 16 storey HDB flats to be sold to the public using the HDB’s “Home Ownership Scheme for the People”. Prior to 1964, all HDB flats were rented from the government and there was no option to buy them even if one could afford to. I lived in block 82 from the time I was born till I was 6.
