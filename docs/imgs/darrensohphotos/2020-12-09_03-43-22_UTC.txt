Depending on how old you are or how long you have lived in MacPherson estate, you will know it either by its oldest name - Persiaran Keliling, or Circuit Road and Pipit Road. Few people actually refer to it as the MacPherson estate. Originally built in the early 1960s, the Circuit Road and Pipit Road area was the site of one of the HDB’s first forays into town building. Over the years, blocks have been demolished and new ones constructed but much of the old estate still stands. Many of the blocks have recently been repainted in this bold and striking colour scheme - making good use of the older blocks’ otherwise no-nonsense and plain facades as a blank canvas.
