And finally to round off the trio, we have this - the building of many names and an amazing history. Located at the junctions of Jalan Besar, Sungei Road and Mayo Street, the building started its life in November 1941 as the White House Hotel. In December that same year it was unfortunately requisitioned by the British War Office. It was however allowed to operate during the Japanese occupation. After the war, it changed names (and presumably Operators) to the South Seas Hotel in 1951 and it remained this for most of its life. However there were still numerous references to it as the White House Hotel till as late as 1980 when a portion of it was demolished for the widening of Sungei Road. So another possibility is that there were two hotels in the same building. Today there is only one operator - Hotel 81, and it has (for better or worse) been painted in Hotel 81 colours.
