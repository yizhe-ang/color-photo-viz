Today Iâ€™m sharing three images of #oldplayground s from my archives, of a handful that are still left standing in #singapore. This last one is probably the second most famous one - the dove at #dakotacrescent the most famous being the #dragonplayground in #toapayoh We now know that the #doveplayground will be conserved along with six blocks of old flats in the estate but did you know up till 2013, another dove existed in #bukitbatok?
