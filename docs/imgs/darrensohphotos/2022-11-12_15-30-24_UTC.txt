@ltasg ‘s Thomson-East Coast Line Stage 3 (TEL3) officially opens tomorrow! Consisting of 11 stations from Stevens TE11 to Gardens By The Bay TE22, a free ride day was held yesterday 11.11.22 open to all across the 11 stations. I was photographing for @arupgroup who provided the engineering for many of the stations like this one, TE19 Shenton Way. Designed by @aedas_architects TE19 is the deepest station on the TEL due to the stacking of platforms. It is also possibly the station with the MOST number of escalators. Did I mention escalators? 😝
