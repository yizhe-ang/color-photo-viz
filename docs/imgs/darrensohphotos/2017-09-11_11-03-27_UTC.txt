Today's next post is still about the former #PUB #building which then became #Singaporepower Building and then finally #tripleonesomerset These are some of the original perspective drawings that were made before the building was built, drawn by a friend's late father who was the draughtsman. Designed by #group2architects of #ongchinbee and #tanpuayhuat the decidedly #modernist #structure was completed in 1977. In 2008, the complex was given a makeover but thankfully still retained its form. It is currently undergoing further #alterations and #additions work and a large part of the facade will now be coloured #gold #sgarchitecture #singaporearchitecture #archdaily #archivingsg #architecture #architecturesg #architecturelovers #architecturephotography #architectureporn#sgarchitecture #singaporearchitecture #archdaily #archivingsg #architecture #architecturesg #architecturelovers #architecturephotography #architectureporn
