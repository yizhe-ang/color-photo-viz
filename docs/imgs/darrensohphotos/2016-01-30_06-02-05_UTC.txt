There was little publicity and it all seemed a little last minute, but it appears that our light boxes are alive and well! For those who missed my #HDB #Facades / #Homescapes showing at the Floating Platform in December, a smaller selection of my work along with that of Bob Lee, @songnian @georgewongyc and @robert_zhao are on show at the @NLB, #Singapore atrium till 21 Feb. This time it's under shelter so there's less chance of the rain affecting the light boxes! Also on show are works from the @urban_sketchers_singapore! The show is part of @sgheartmap #sg50 celebrations from last year but obviously the powers that be think it will worth putting the show back up again! ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ #shotoniphone6s #nofilter #sglandscape #sgarchitecture #architecture #archivingsg #architecturalphotography #architecturesg
