I've tried (as have many others) to try to find a center point at #rafflesplace shooting upwards but have not been successful for years. Today I returned, armed with the #voigtlander10mm on the #sonya7rii and managed to find this angle with both the #singaporelandtower and #onerafflesplace lit by the noon sun with all the other buildings in shadow and found my shot. #architecturephotography #igsg #architectureporn #architecture #cbd #cityscape #singapore #archdaily #architecturelovers #sonyalphaprofessionals
