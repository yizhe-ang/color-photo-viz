Yesterday, on 9 August 2022, the Padang became Singapore's 75th National Monument. 

With this gazette, it joins its storied neighbours like the Victoria Memorial Hall (completed more or less to this current form in 1906), the former City Hall (1929) and the former Supreme Court (1939) in the league of the most protected spaces and structures in Singapore.

This final photo in my series of three was made during the mourning week for the founding Prime Minister of Singapore Lee Kuan Yew as crowds queued, some overnight, in order to pay their last respects to MM Lee as his body laid in state at the Parliament House in late March 2015.
