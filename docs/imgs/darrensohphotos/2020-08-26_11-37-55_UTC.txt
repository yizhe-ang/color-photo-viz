City Vue @ Henderson is probably one of the most underrated mega projects the HDB has completed in recent times.

Perhaps because it is decidedly “ordinary” in design or that it isn’t designed by any famous architect more well known for private sector projects, the project has largely flown under the radar.

Designed by @surbanajurong , City Vue is actually significant for it holds the replacement flats for those affected by the SERS exercise at Redhill Close, the final SIT project outside of Tiong Bahru still under the HDB’s care. Itself built over the site of demolished HDB blocks, City Vue is also has second tallest HDB flats ever built - standing at 48 storeys, only 2 floors shorter than Pinnacle @ Duxton.

Built in 2018, City Vue was a recipient at last year’s HDB Awards. 

Of note in this panorama are the comparatively much shorter blocks on the right most of the image which includes the first blocks of 4-room flats ever built by the HDB in Singapore located at Henderson Crescent completed in 1967 and also Singapore’s tallest slab block - block 105 Henderson Crescent, which stands at 24 floors in height - the same height as some point blocks.
