Low light #nightphotography in #nocturnal conditions used to be the bane of any #mobilephotography because the #physics of a tiny sensor made it next to impossible to make usable images when the device automatically pumped the ISO gain of the sensor up to compensate for this lack of light. However the advent of big #aperture lenses on #mobilephone cameras like the f1.8 lens on the #iphone7 and #iphone7plus combined with full manual controls offered by third party apps and the ability to shoot #raw #adobedraw has been a big #gamechanger I made this image of the #singapore #skyline and #cbd at #dusk last week using the iPhone's 28mm f1.8 lens and with care, the results are nothing short of amazing. #architecturephotography #architecture #archdaily #architecturesg #sgarchitecture #cityscape #landscapephotography #landscape #sglandscape #landscapesg #archivingsg #shotoniphone7plus #shotoniphone7
