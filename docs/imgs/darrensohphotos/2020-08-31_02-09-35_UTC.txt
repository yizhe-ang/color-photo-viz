The HDB stopped building public housing in the central core of the city from the 1980s because of the advent of the MRT which provided much faster and better linkage to the rest of the island.

The final HDB blocks completed in the city were these flats at Rowell Court off Jalan Besar. The last block was completed in 1985 and after that the HDB did not build in the city again until the first SERS flats at Boon Tiong Road were completed in 2000, a 15 year gap of nearly a generation.
