About 7 years ago, I started a project to photograph the light trails left by construction cranes in Singapore at night. Because the economy had recently recovered from the world financial crisis of 2008-2010, there was a massive amount of large construction projects and this gave me a lot to photograph. This is the #interlace by @buroolescheeren for @capitaland photographed in 2012 when it was still about a year or so from completion. The project came to be known as #unfinishedbusiness Perhaps I should continue it again since there is again a large amount of construction going on now.
