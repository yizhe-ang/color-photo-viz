At the North Eastern corner of Yishun near the Lower Seletar Reservoir is a newly completed HDB Precinct by the name of Valley Spring. Officially, it is also known as HDB Yishun N4C22 (Neighbourhood 4 Contract 22).

Consisting of 824 units ranging from 2-Room Flexi to 4-Room flats spread over 6 blocks, the precinct was designed and engineered by @pt_group_official and built by Teambuild Engineering & Construction.

For those of you that have seen the project in person, you may have noticed that the blocks of the precinct are all joined by a series of link bridges. These link bridges are on level 8 and not only join the blocks to each other but also to the roof garden on the top of the precinct's Multi-Storey Car Park (MSCP).

With these link bridges, it is entirely possible for you to walk from any block in the precinct to another without having to go to the ground level. In fact, you can very well plan a jog along the level 8 common corridors centered around the roof garden and workout that way if you so wish.

However, these link bridges and their connectivity is but just one of the features in the precinct that makes it interesting. You see, Valley Spring is the very first HDB precinct to be built using the pre-fabricated pre-finished volumetric construction (PPVC) method which uses, you got it, pre-fabricated and-finished 3D components (essentially a room) that are assembled on site like Lego bricks.

Conventional wisdom would dictate that if such a highly modular system of building is employed, the resulting building would be boring but P&T has shown that this doesn't need to be the way, and while walking the site, I actually found the link bridges to be a very refreshing way of getting around the precinct.
