Because of the way the building curves around itself and also because of its facing, there are some months of the year where parts of the corridor AND the entrance to some of the units do not receive any direct sunlight. .

For example, the sun is now tracking from the North till June, so any North facing buildings will face plenty of sunlight - and for the case of #PearlBankApartments the units facing the Central Expressway and Pearl's Hill will be in the sun almost the entire day. This also means less light inside the curved common corridor facade, and should the building survive till June, more light will start creeping back into the inside of the curve in the afternoons. .
