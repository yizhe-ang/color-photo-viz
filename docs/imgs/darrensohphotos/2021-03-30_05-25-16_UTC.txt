In a dense city state like Singapore, it is really hard to find areas untouched by human intervention no matter where you go. I explored this more in the sequel to While You Were Sleeping - titled In The Still Of The Night and published in 2015.

There is a section of the Green Corridor in Kranji (yes that controversial part) where the NS MRT line directly bisects the former railway line and four years after the railway stopped running in 2015, I made this photo from where the train tracks would have been.

While You Were Sleeping - The Documentary directed by @ieremv premieres tomorrow 31 March on the @objectifscentre YouTube channel at 2100hrs. Do join us!
