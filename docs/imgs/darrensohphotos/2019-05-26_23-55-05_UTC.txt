This is Peninsula Plaza. Peninsula Plaza is a space most photographers in Singapore would be very familiar with due to the concentration of camera shops in it as well as in the nearby Excelsior and Peninsula Shopping Centres.

All three buildings were designed by Edward Wong of Alfred Wong Partnership and Peninsula Plaza was completed in 1980. The architecture is Neo-Gothic and AWP was inspired by the Neo-Gothic St. Andrewâ€™s Cathedral just next to it.

It boasts a double setback receding facade with a lower and upper podium followed by the tower.

Due to the fact that the setbacks are quite pronounced, it is really not easy to observe them from street level. However, the back of the building is basically flush flat so this is one of two angles from which one can photograph the massing. Unfortunately, due to all the tall buildings in the area, one needs to time it to a particular month of the year before any light falls on the building from this angle, and I have tried to catch that light in this image.

Peninsula Plaza has recently undergone extensive renovations which removed all the iridescent brown mosaic tiles which were falling apart but thankfully the rest of the facade and its beautiful mosaic finishing were restored instead of bastardised.
