When the HDB was first formed in February 1960, it concentrated on building a very typical type of HDB block called the slab block. The slab block was so named because it looked like a slab sitting on the landscape and it came in a few variations. Some slab blocks were angled, while others were curved, but the majority were straight and well, looked like a slab. :) In 1970, the HDB started to introduce a new typology of HDB block called the Point Block. If you live in Singapore, you would have seen one of these at one point or another (pun intended hur hur), and you would be forgiven if you (like I did until a few years ago) assumed that all point blocks contained 5-Room HDB flats of 1 living room, 1 dining room and three bedrooms with 2 toilets and a kitchen. 
In the late 1970s and 1980s, the HDB started to vary the internal designs and layout of point blocks. For example, blocks 173 (left) and 168(right) Bishan Street 13 are two of only thirteen HDB point blocks in Bishan with four maisonette penthouses per block, making a total of only 52 units of this kind in existence in Bishan. Built between 1986 and 1987, they are now over thirty years old. .
