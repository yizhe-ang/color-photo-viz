It may seem unimaginable but the HDB only started to work with private sector architects from 1991, some 31 years after its founding in a system introduced then called the Design and Build Scheme. I had previously written about the first of these but the next three posts are dedicated to the second one. This second Design and Build precinct, also along Tampines St 45 like the first was Contract 25, or Tampines N4C25.

It was awarded to @designlinkarchitects and Sim Lian Construction. Work commenced in March 1993 and the ten blocks in the precinct were completed in August 1995.

The precinct won a Construction Industry Development Board (CIDB) Construction Excellence Award in 1997. The CIDB was the predecessor of the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) a name we are probably more familiar with today.

In the citation for the award, it was said that: "The use of modularised window size provided a uniform and distinct facade appearance. The full height window located at the living room for four-room units and at the master bedroom for executive apartments present an aesthetically finished facade which gives the resident a pleasant external view. The entrance arch to each block provides a distinct identity to individual block."
