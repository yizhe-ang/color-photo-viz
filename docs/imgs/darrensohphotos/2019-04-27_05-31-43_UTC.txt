We’re back to regular programming but it feels as if the monsoon is either 4 months late or 7 months early zzzz so of course we make lemon juice when life gives you lemons or in my case, #puddlegram when life gives me puddles. This is the infamous #peoplesparkcomplex #rooftop #carpark that is almost always flooded even when there is the slightest of rain but you can imagine what it’s like now.

There used to be a cafe named #lepak on the roof top carpark that has since closed but it didn’t stop these two young ladies for trekking up there to “lepak one corner” by the puddles.
