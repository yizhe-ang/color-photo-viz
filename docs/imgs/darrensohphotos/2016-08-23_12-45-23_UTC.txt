This is block 82 #commonwealthclose on the hill across from #commonwealth #mrt station in @myqueenstown where I grew up as a child. Built in #1967 the three blocks on the hill are known as the #zhuplucklao blocks because they are 16 storeys tall. I have photographed this block many times but I have never been able to get this view in one shot. With new technology in lenses, this is now possible. #architecturelovers #archilovers #archdaily #architecturephotography #architecture #hdb #publichousing #singapore #queenstown #sonyalphaprofessionals #sonya7rii #voigtlander #voigtlander10mm 006/006
