Officially completed in 1973 but actually built in phases between 1971 and 1974, Golden Mile Complex was originally named Woh Hup Complex after the company that developed and built the complex. @wohhupgroup is one of Singaporeâ€™s oldest home grown builders having been in existence for nearly a century and through Singapura Developments, a former subsidiary set up in aid of nation building, Golden Mile Complex was born. Its architects were Tay Kheng Soon, William Lim and Gan Eng Oon. Last year, the @urasingapore announced that the government would be considering Golden Mile Complex for conservation given its unique architecture and place in history.
