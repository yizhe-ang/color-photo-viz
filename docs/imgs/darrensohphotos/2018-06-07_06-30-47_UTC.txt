This is #tanglinhalt estate, previously known as #Queenstown neighbourhood IV, one of the oldest #hdb #publichousing estates in #singapore conceived and built in the early 1960s and fully coming online just after independence in 1965. It is also the site of the largest ever Selective Enbloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS) projects to date, where EVERY Low rise block you see in this panorama will be demolished once residents move out in late 2020. @myqueenstown
