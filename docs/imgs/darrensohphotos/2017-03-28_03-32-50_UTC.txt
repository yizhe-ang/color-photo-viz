Blocks 232 and 233 #bainstreet or better known to most people in #singapore as #brasbasah #complex as you probably have not seen it before (or not noticed anyways). The #hdb used to build a lot of #podium complexes such as this one. #rochorcentre #honglimcomplex and #tanjongpagarplaza are other examples. It's getting a fresh coat of #turquoise paint right now. #architecture #archivingsg #architecturesg #architecturelovers #architecturephotography #archdaily #cbd #urbanliving #cityliving #urbanism #sonya7rii #sonyalphaprofessionals
