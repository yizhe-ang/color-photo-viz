This is the one of the views from the soon to be closed and demolished #rochorcentre in #singapore The #publichousing complex was built in the mid 1970s and its RGBY colours have made it a #landmark and icon in the area. However it will soon make way for the construction of a #tunnel and all residents will have to move out in the next 2-3 months. #cityscape #architecture #architecturelovers #architecturephotography #archilovers #archdaily one of the things I will certainly miss is the view, including this one which shows #normanfoster 's #southbeach very clearly. #nocturnal #nightphotography #sg #enbloc #hdb #citylights #cityliving
