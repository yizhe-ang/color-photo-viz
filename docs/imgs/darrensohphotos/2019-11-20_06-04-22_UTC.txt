Iâ€™ve always said that in Singapore, the only constant is change.

Nowhere else is this more apparent than in our built landscape, where old buildings are demolished and new buildings built at a pace faster than most other nations. Even our public housing blocks have to change at least every seven years in the form of a complete repainting and sometimes this results in a new paint scheme less attractive than the former.

In this next three posts I will be sharing what some HDB blocks used to look like before they were repainted to their current colours.

And finally we have one of the most iconic of blocks in Queenstown, block  168A Queensway, a one of a kind unique butterfly-shaped block that was the result of an HDB experiment in the 1970s to introduce more interesting block designs.

The butterfly block is today covered in grey with orange accents but this was how it used to look prior.
