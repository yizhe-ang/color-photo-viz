The #singaporenightfestival #sgnightfest is back for its 10th edition this year and the organisers are pulling out all the stops for a stunning show. This is #convolutions by French visual band @ez3kielofficiel  and they're using the #facade of the @natmuseum_sg as a #backdrop for this stunning piece. Catch the nightly performances that will end this weekend 26th August. @angelitateo @brasbasahbugis #archdaily #archivingsg #architecture #architecturesg #architecturelovers #architecturephotography #singapore #singaporearchitecture #nightphotography #nocturnalwonderland #nocturn #sonya7rii #sonyalpha #sonyalphaphotos #sonyalphaprofessionals #voigtlander #voigtlander10mm #panorama 003/003
