In 1962, the Singapore campus of the University of Malaya split to form the University of Singapore. Centered around the former Raffles College at Bukit Timah, the university set out to build a new Science Tower in 1964 in order to accommodate an increasing demand in science-based tertiary education in Singapore. 

Ho Kok Hoe was to be the architect for this new 10-storey tower and he travelled to Britain in 1963 to study how the tertiary institutions there built and and organised their science buildings. 

The Science Tower was completed in 1966 and officially declared open by founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew on 1 July 1966. It originally housed the Chemistry Department of the new university. 

The tallest building in the Bukit Timah campus even till today, the Science Tower later became the headquarters of the National Institute of Education (NIE) (1982-2000) and later was part of the interim campus for the Singapore Management University (2000-2005). Today, the Science Tower has been renamed the Tower Block and is once again part of the National University of Singapore, housing the Centre for International Law. 

The former Science Tower was gazetted as a conservation building in 2006 along with other significant modernist buildings in the Bukit Timah Campus after it was reallocated back to NUS.
