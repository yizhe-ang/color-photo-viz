How many former rally grounds from previous elections don't exist anymore?

This open field along Boon Keng Road and Upper Serangoon Road was where the Workers' Party held their rally on 3rd September 2015 for Jalan Besar GRC.

This long rectangular field is interesting because it was once home to rows of shophouses directly across the road from the Kwong Wai Shiu Hospital which still stands today.

The field is now a construction site, where a new HDB Public Housing estate - Kempas Residences, named for Kempas Road that runs parallel to Lavender Street, is currently being built.

I have once wondered last GE where rallies would be held in the next GE as more and more open spaces become construction sites, and I guess the answer we have this COVID19 pandemic season is - nowhere.
