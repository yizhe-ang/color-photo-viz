Seven years ago yesterday, the final #ktm #keretapitanahmelayu #train to ever leave #tanjongpagar #tanjongpagarrailwaystation departed on its final journey back to #malaysia The trains would never run on these tracks again after that night. In the months leading up to 30 June 2011, I made a series of photos of the #senandungexpress as it departed Singapore at 2200hrs for #kualalumpur and every night when I was shooting I would camp at a spot where the train would pass. This is my favourite image from the series, made at the #Kranji crossing where the train would go under the #mrt line.
