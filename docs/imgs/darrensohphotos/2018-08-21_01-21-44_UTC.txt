#BeforeItAllGoes is my most important show to date as we mature as a country and develop at a relentless pace - is there space for the old and the new to coexist in #singapore ? Is a #tabularasa the only solution in a land scarce island like ours? What will happen to our built #heritage? I donâ€™t have quick answers to all these but these are the hard questions we all need to ask ourselves if we are to grow as a nation. See you tonight! The exhibition runs till 29 Sep. .
