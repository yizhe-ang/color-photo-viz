We've been having a number of very unusually foggy mornings (two in the past two months) here in Singapore due to the super high amount of moisture in the air leftover from strong storms the day or night before and I've tried to make photos on the both times itâ€™s happened. 

This image of Ang Mo Kio and Bishan with Bishan Park in between them was made on 30 March about three weeks ago while I was testing the new 14mm f1.8 G Master ultra wide angle lens for @sonysingapore and I made this image using that lens.

This was about 745am in the morning and the sun had already risen considerably high off the horizon but because of the thick fog and mist (never thought I would say that in relation to Singapore) the sun was obscured but instead we had this amazingly diffused light quality that is so unusual for Singapore.

Here's a rule of thumb for those hoping to capture this phenomenon when it next happens - try to find somewhere with lots of preferably thick vegetation - the trees ensure that the air surrounding them are full of moisture and the effects are usually very dramatic.
