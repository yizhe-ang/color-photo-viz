"Today, The Pinnacle@Duxton stands in place of the basic 10-storey rental housing blocks built in March 1963 and completed at the end of the same year. The first 50-storey HDB block, the tallest HDB block in our history, is a significant milestone on our way forward. It is the first public housing designed through an award winning international competition. A distinctive feature is its twelve sky bridges that link all 7 blocks forming one of the longest continuous sky gardens in the world." - Lee Kuan Yew, 13th December 2009.

On the 13th of December 2009, exactly ten years ago today, the residents of Pinnacle @ Duxton received their keys at a Key Handover Ceremony at 0900hrs from none other than their Member of Parliament, Minister Mentor and founding Prime Minister of Singapore - Lee Kuan Yew.

Ten years later, Pinnacle @ Duxton continues to be an amazing example of what high density urban public housing can be like and it will be a case study for decades and centuries to come yet. Pinnacle @ Duxton is designed by @khoopengbeng  and @belindahuang8 of Arc Studio Architecture & Urbanism together with @rspdesigners .
