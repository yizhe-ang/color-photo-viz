The #iphonexs and #iphonexsmax may just be an S upgrade by Apple with the same form factor as last year, but the improvements in terms of the #camera and #photography are really under the hood. This evening, I made this image of #peoplesparkcomplex #珍珠坊 set in #Chinatown #singapore with #peoplesparkcentre to its right as well as the #construction of the new #statecourts building by #seriearchitects and #multiplyarchitectsllp #shotoniphonexsmax just because I now really can make clean dusk shots with an iPhone. .
