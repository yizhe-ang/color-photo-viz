Block 26 #jalanklinik in #bukithoswee must be one of the MOST photographed #hdb #publichousing blocks in #singapore It is one of a handful left in the whole country that still has a completely porous common corridor where the parapet wall is made of metal grilles instead of concrete. Interesting it is the ONLY block of its kind in Bukit Ho Swee. .
