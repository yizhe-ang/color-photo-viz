I made this image of #goldenmilecomplex and #goldenmiletower with the #masjidhajjahfatimah in the foreground many years ago before the new hotel on #beachroad existed. Few people know that the #hajjahfatimahmosque is a #nationalmonument and itâ€™s a pity that the trees around it have obscured almost all views of it. .
