This afternoon I had a chance to preview #changiT4 ahead of its official open house next week and made some images in the space. Designed by a #consortium of architects including @benoyglobal @aecom #saaarchitects #becacarterhollings&ferner @changiairport 's newest terminal is due to open either by early next year. These #pebble motifs are literally everywhere in the terminal, these ones are skylights on the roof of the #departurehall #singapore #archdaily #architecture #architecturesg #sgarchitecture #architecturelovers #architecturephotography #sonyalphaprofessionals #sonyalphaphotos #sonya7rii #sonyalpha #Sony
