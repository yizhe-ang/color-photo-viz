#peoplesparkcomplex or #珍珠坊 Designed by the original @dparchitects of #taykhengsoon #williamlim and #kohseowchuan People's Park Complex was completed in 1973 which makes it 45 years old this year. Like #goldenmilecomplex it embodies the #metabolist movement and was one of #singapore 'a first #mixeduse #development s. This is my favourite view of it because it allows you to see the volume of the #podium and when you realise that base is 7 storeys tall you can better appreciate the scale of this #megastructure #sgarchitecture #singaporearchitecture #archdaily #archivingsg #architecture #architecturesg #architecturelovers #architecturephotography #architectureporn #enblocfever #guardiancities
