I recently brought some friends from Hong Kong to visit the #blessedsacramentchurch in @myqueenstown which is one of the few conserved buildings in the historically important estate. Designed by #vansitterenandpartners the interiors of the church have always amazed me and it is extremely photogenic from all angles. #sgarchitecture #architecturesg #architecturephotography #archivingsg #archdaily #architecture #architecturelovers #singapore #igsg #sgig #sonya7rii #sonyalphaprofessionals #voigtlander #voigtlander10mm
