Today's post is a #shoutout to @dparchitects on the occasion of their #50thanniversary Much of #singapore was designed by #dparchitects including the iconic #peoplesparkcomplex and #goldenmilecomplex which are my #favourite #buildings in this country. Here is a #panorama showing the frontal #facade of Golden Mile Complex, a view I can never tire of. #metabolism #metabolist #metabolistarchitecture #taykhengsoon #williamlim #ganengoon #sgarchitecture #archdaily #archivingsg #architecturesg #architecture #architecturelovers #architecturephotography #modernist #modernism #sonya7rii #sonyalpha #sonyalphaphotos #sonyalphaprofessionals
