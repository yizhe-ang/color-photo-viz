It was my honour to be back in #surabaya for the weekend as an invited judge for this year’s  @gada_petra an architectural Photo Contest organised by architecture students from @uk_petra and my heart is really full from the hospitality of the students like @evelyxgunawan @tristansalim and all the rest whom I have yet to add on Instagram. Instagram is really big here, as is evident in the fact that this mosque, the Masjid @hidayatullahsiwalankerto that is just a stone’s throw from Petra University that I photographed from the air yesterday has its own Insta page. It’s been a blast Surabaya and I will be back! .
