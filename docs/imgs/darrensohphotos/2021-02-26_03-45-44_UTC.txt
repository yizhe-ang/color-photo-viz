I had earlier posted images of the Ang Mo Kio Autopoint which is one of a very few examples in Singapore of Hightech Architecture or Structural Expressionism.

I also mentioned that perhaps the best known example of Structural Expressionism in Singapore is this - the Singapore Post Centre.

In the 1990s, Singapore Post held an architecture competition for its new headquarters and General Post Office building to be built at Eunos / Paya Lebar. The competition was won by Kumpulan Akitek but the final design was slightly reworked and executed by RDC Architects.

The Singapore Post Centre or SingPost Centre as it is known today was completed in 1999. Clad in glass and steel with exposed elevator shafts and exterior staircases, the complex is decidedly futuristic as compared to its surrounding flatted and low rise factories.
