Because of the haze, I had to find a large indoor space in order to try out the ultra wide angle camera of the #iPhone11ProMax so I decided on the Cloud Forest at @gardensbythebay and timed my trip to coincide with the final misting of the day at 8pm. If you are familiar with the Cloud Forest you will know that it is impossible to capture this FOV with the standard wide angle camera on any previous iPhone so it was breathtaking to finally be able to make this image on the iPhone 11 Pro Max.
