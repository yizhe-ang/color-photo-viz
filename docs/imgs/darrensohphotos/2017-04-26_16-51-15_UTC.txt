It is #impei 's #100th birthday today and I'm going to be using my #insta panel of three images today to celebrate his three projects in #singapore in chronological order. Finally and certainly not least, we have the two #minimalist #knifeedge #structures of #thegateway completed in 1990. When they were completed, there was absolutely nothing in their way and they truly served as a gateway into the #rochor area from the #kallangbasin  #archivingsg #archdaily #architecture #architecturesg #architecturelovers #architecturephotography  #sgarchitecture #singaporearchitecture
