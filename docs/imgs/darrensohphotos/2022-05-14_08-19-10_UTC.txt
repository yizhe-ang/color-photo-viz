In February this year, @singtel announced that it would be redeveloping its HQ building - Comcentre after 2024 and would be appointing a developer to demolish and rebuild a new building on its site. That was the beginning of the end for this tower that had stood "at the back of Orchard Road" since 1978 and become very much a landmark of both the neighbourhood AND Singapore.

Comcentre was first announced by the then Telecommunication Authority of Singapore (TAS) or simply Telecoms in 1974 and would consolidate all its operations under one roof. It was to be built on Exeter Road alongside the Orchard Telephone Exchange. Designed by @bepakitek undertaken by then partners Ong Eng Hung, Yang Soo Suan, Tay Lee Soon and Alex Foo, Comcentre was completed in late 1978 and officially declared open by then Minister for Communications Ong Teng Cheong in 1979.

A defining feature of the building was a space frame structure running the entire width of the tower’s roof, which was designed to “support up to 20 microwave dishes three-metres in diameter as well as other telecommunication antennae.”

The building was also constructed in a similar way to OCBC Building, where the two gable sides were constructed first and then the middle filled in along the way. Of note, BEP Akitek served as the local partners for I.M. Pei for OCBC Building. 

I walked around the neighbourhood making some images of Comcentre last Thursday as a reminder to myself of how elegant this piece of modernist architecture was and still is today, some forty three years after it was completed.
