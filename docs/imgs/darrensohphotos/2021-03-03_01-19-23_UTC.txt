As the largest property developer in Singapore, the HDB is in a unique position to push building technologies and methods because it has the economies of scale to do so.

However, because of cost, the HDB was not the earliest adopters of precast building technology and along the way in its history, the HDB actually did run into several setbacks, some of which were quite severe, when it came to implementing precast building technology at scale.

In the 1990s, the HDB embarked on large scale upgrading of older precincts, and this meant that precast building technology had to be rolled out on massive scale in precincts where additional rooms / service balconies were added to old 3-room flats and embellishments added to block facades.

When it came to building new blocks, the 1990s was decidedly PostModern in architectural style even for the HDB, and bold geometric shapes were commonly found.

At the end of the 1990s, the HDB undertook a very interesting exercise in pushing concrete prefabrication to another level with a large number of Design Plus public housing blocks in Fernvale Sengkang.

Using precast panels set in a mold of a fairly complicated prismatic shape, the HDB emblazoned the facades of some nine blocks with these panels that served no purpose other than being aesthetically pleasing.

The design of these blocks were featured in an article in the June 1999 issue of Houseword - the inhouse newsletter of the HDB, with executive architect Lim Keng Yong quouted as saying "We are trying out something new in facade design that we've never done before - using undulating panels(.)"

The article goes on to explain how HDB engineers have worked on the angle of the prismatic design so that they would be able to achieve consistent and error free results in the prefabrication of the panels. 

These blocks in Fernvale were completed between 2002 and 2004.
