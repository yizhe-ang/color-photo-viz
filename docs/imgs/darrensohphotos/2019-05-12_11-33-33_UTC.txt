Blocks 55 (in the light), 56, 58, 59, 60, 62 and 63 Commonwealth Drive in Queenstown are some of the oldest HDB Public Housing blocks in Singapore.

Completed in 1962 and like all HDB flats built before 1964, they were rental flats until they were converted in the late 1960s to owned units. This is why if you check on their age using conventional means, they all have a lease dating from 1969 which is not indicative of their built date.

These 7 blocks, like nearly two dozen others, were part of the HDBâ€™s largest Selective Enbloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS) and will be demolished after 2020 when replacement blocks in Margaret Drive are ready.

Until then, we must meticulously document not just the architecture but also the stories of the residents, some who have stayed there from the very beginning.

Before it all goes.

EDIT: Thanks to @mrleeheng who pointed this out to me, I have learnt that Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong used to live in block 55 when he was younger. .
