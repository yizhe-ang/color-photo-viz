The #building that has known many names in the 40 years that it has existed: #PUB #building #Singaporepower Building and then finally #tripleonesomerset is finally getting that #gold #cladding I talked about some months ago.  Originally designed by #group2architects of #ongchinbee and #tanpuayhuat the decidedly #modernist #structure was completed in 1977. In 2008, the complex was given a makeover but thankfully still retained its form. It is currently undergoing further #alterations and #additions work.
