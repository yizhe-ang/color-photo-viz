Paul Rudolph was born on October 23 1918 in Elkton, Kentucky and if he were still alive today he would have just turned 100. Today’s three images are shared from my personal project documenting the last of Rudolph’s great projects - all located in South East Asia, two in Singapore and two in Indonesia, located in Jakarta and Surabaya. This is The Concourse in Singapore, completed in 1994 and the second last of Rudolph’s projects in the region before his death in 1997. I am a firm believer that The Concourse is the most beautifully lit skyscraper in all of Singapore.
