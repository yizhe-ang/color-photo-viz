Block 68 Toa Payoh Lorong 5 is one of a handful of HDB Public Housing blocks left in Singapore with these ventilation blocks on every floor at the lift landing. The most famous block in Singapore to feature this exact design of ventilation blocks must be the long demolished flats at Geylang Serai next to the old Geylang Serai market.

Built in 1966 as part of the first batch of flats completed in Toa Payoh, Block 68 is T-shaped and comprises 240 flats in total, with 11 3-room flats and 229 2-room flats.
