Completed in 1974, Block 168A #Queensway is a unique double curved “butterfly” block in #Queenstown #singapore that has been an #iconic #hdb #publichousing #block in the neighbourhood for the last 44 years. It is currently receiving a new coat of paint so I suppose it’s here to stay for awhile yet. .
