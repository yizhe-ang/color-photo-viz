When we started working on #BeforeItAllGoes some five months ago, we worked on the premise of buildings that were already gone like #buonavistaswimmingcomplex (left) and others, like the #bedokswimmingcomplex (right) that had closed but not yet demolished. However, just a week before the exhibition opened, @kangshua sent me a photo showing excavators being moved to the complex and we knew the time had come to really say goodbye. Before It All Goes runs till Sep 29 at @objectifscentre .
