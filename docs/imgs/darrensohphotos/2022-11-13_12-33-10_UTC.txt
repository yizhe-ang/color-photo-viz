A book literally several years in the making, @jiathwee , @justinzhuang and I are proud to finally present you EVERYDAY MODERNISM, a book on our encounters with modernism in everyday Singapore, a book that not just covers the heroic architecture we are so familiar with from Singapore's early independent years but also the more vernecular - from revolving restaurants (which no longer revolve like the Prima Tower and the Change Alley Aerial Plaza) to multi-storey carparks and even some overhead pedestrian bridges. Also featured are lesser known modernist structures like the MND annex building and the not-so-unknown modernist beauty like Peninsula Plaza (both pictured here). 

Join us on 22 November Tuesday at the National Design Centre 7pm level 2 auditorium as we launch the book and have a relaxed anecdotal discussion about what went on behind the scenes to get to where we have with the volume. EVERYDAY MODERNISM was beautifully designed by @hanson_ho and is published by @nus_press 

Iâ€™m also really happy to also announce a 20% discount code valid for any purchase of the book from now till 30 November - MODERN20 - used on the NUS Press web store - link in my bio above!
