Last Saturday #BeforeItAllGoes received a special guest in the form of @j_o_a_n_n_a_d_o_n_g Thank you for dropping by and letâ€™s all get word out about the impending demise of many of our modernist icons - that it is still not too late to save some of them and that we should strive for a #singapore where the old and new can coexist in our landscape! Please visit the exhibition at @objectifscentre if you have not done so - they open again tomorrow Tuesday 4 Sep at noon. .
