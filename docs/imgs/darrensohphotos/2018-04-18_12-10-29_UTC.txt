If the #singapore #cbd were a #mountainrange the #amoystreet #telokayerstreet area would be the foothills of those mountains, sometimes in the #rainshadow if the storm is approaching from the coast. Traditionally this would be the most fertile part of the range and settlers would make homes and farms for themselves there. Here in Singapore, this is where the office workers of #robinsonroad and #cecilstreet flock to for lunch every day. :)
