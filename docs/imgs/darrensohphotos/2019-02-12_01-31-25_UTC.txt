Originally an area of rubber plantations and farms, Bukit Panjang (or Long Hill in Malay) was first developed as a HDB Public Housing estate relatively late only in the late 1980s. But once development began, thousands of flats were built. These flats at Jelapang Road in the town were built later in 1998 and the architects from the HDB said that the terraced stepped blocks were inspired by the undulating landscape of the terrain in that area. .
