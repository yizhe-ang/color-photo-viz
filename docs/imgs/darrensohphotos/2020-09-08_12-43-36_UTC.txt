@Apple Marina Bay Sands opens to the public this Thursday 10 September. Designed by Apple in collaboration with Foster + Partners, the store features an underground avenue clad with the now iconic stonework that adorns many Apple stores around the world. The store also features a glass sphere with an oculus at the apex of the dome set entirely in @marinabaysg

This is an image looking up toward the oculus at about 1pm in the afternoon.

I had an exclusive opportunity to photograph the Apple Marina Bay Sands Store for @designandarchitecturemag and the piece is now live! Link to the story is in my bio.
