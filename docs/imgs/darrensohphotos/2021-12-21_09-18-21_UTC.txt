The Bukit Timah Waterworks were called the Bukit Timah Filters and Clear Water Tank when they were first built in 1891. They were conceived and designed by James MacRitchie, who was Municipal Engineer of Singapore from 1883 to his untimely death in 1895. During his tenure as Municipal Engineer, MacRitchie not only expanded Singapore’s waterworks but also completed the Telok Ayer Market (known today as Lau Pa Sat) and pioneered the use of iron for bridge building in all of Malaya. When he died, the newspapers called MacRitchie the “most important man in the community”.
