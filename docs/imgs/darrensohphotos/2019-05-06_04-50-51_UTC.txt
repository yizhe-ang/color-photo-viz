One of the things we wanted to achieve when making #BeforeItAllGoes was to try and understand why #singapore goes through all these tumultuous changes in its built environment and also figure out of there were any other paths available besides the destruction and demolition of old buildings. In this trailer, we spoke to @randychan0000 principal of Zarch Collaboratives and mused on the above. Once again, the full documentary can be viewed using the link in my bio. .
