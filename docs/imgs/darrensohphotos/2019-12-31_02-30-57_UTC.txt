It is the last day of the year and decade and while we’ve been distracted by eclipses and festivities, it’s time to end the decade right with three posts on public housing in Singapore.

This is Tampines St 45 (HDB Tampines New Town N4C24) - designed by P&T Architects and Engineers (P&T Consultants here in Singapore), @pt_group_official formerly known as Palmer and Turner.

The firm has a storied past, and is actually one of the longest surviving architectural firms in Asia. Established in 1868 in Hong Kong by Englishman William Salway who designed many many buildings in Australia, the firm took its name from two partners who joined later - Clement Palmer and Arthur Turner, hence Palmer and Turner, which was incorporated in 1895.

Here in Singapore, they were most famous for the rebuilding and restoration of the Goodwood Park Hotel (1959-1960) and also the Bank of China Building (1953-1954). Interesting, Palmer and Turner designed the buildings for the Bank of China in Shanghai, Hong Kong AND Singapore, and all three share very similar Art Deco designs.

Completed in 1994, Tampines St 45 was the FIRST HDB estate to be designed by architects outside of the HDB and features a strong triple courtyard design and unfortunately can only be fully seen from the air.

Completed entirely in brick (a large part of which was fair-faced), the estate continues to stand out in Tampines even today.

As for P&T Consultants, many of you might actually live in a HDB estate designed by them because they continue to design for the HDB.
