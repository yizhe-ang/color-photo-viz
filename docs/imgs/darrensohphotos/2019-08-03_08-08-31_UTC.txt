It’s that time of the year again to show overt displays of patriotism or jump on the bandwagon anyway. I’m pretty sure symmetrical national flags are not in the brief, but it does make for an interesting photo.

As a side note (but probably more important than the aesthetics of this image)this is block 48 Lower Delta Road, one of many very old HDB public housing blocks that were built in the early 1960s in Bukit Ho Swee after the fire of 1961. There are 382 2-Room flats in this block and most recently one of them has changed hands on the resale market for $200,000 despite a lease of only 44 years of its 99 year lease left.

I will be sharing my photography documenting Singapore and the concept of home for Today At Apple on 10 August 2019, 1600hrs - 1800hrs. Sign up link in my bio.
