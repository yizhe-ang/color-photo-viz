#modernism at stake. In the wake of the collective sale of #pearlbank #pearlbankapartments four other modernist megastructures in #singapore have begun #collectivesale proceedings. These are #peoplesparkcomplex #goldenmiletower #peoplesparkcentre and this - #goldenmilecomplex which is arguably the greatest of them all. Together with #珍珠坊 they were both completed in 1973 and were the first mixed use developments in #singapore. I have been making images at the Golden Mile for years but it feels especially urgent to document the entire precinct now.
