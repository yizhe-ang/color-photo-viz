This morningâ€™s @marinabaysg countdown fireworks was a literal blast with 90 mins worth of fireworks display. Because it was going to be insanely crowded, I chose to photograph from Changi instead with a Super telephoto lens and despite being halfway across the island, I could see everything really clearly too. Happy 2020 everyone!
