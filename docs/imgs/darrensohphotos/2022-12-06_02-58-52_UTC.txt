By far the most photographed of the HDB mixed-use complexes in the city was Rochor Centre. Its primary colour scheme that was only added later in its life as well as the fact that its impending demise was announced the same year as Instagram was launched (2010) led it to become one of the most instagrammed buildings in Singapore before its demolition in 2018 - 2019.

Most people know how the four red, green, blue and yellow blocks look like, so let’s focus instead here on the very interesting but often overlooked floor tile patterns in the middle of Rochor Centre’s massive courtyard. In addition to a podium roof that served as a void deck, Rochor Centre had a courtyard between the blocks at ground level of generous proportions not found in the other mixed-use HDB projects in the city. This was partially achieved by pushing the parking underground instead of using precious space to build a multi storey carpark like the complexes at Tanjong Pagar and Hong Lim.
