Singapore turns 53 this coming Thursday, and along with her, many of our #pioneergeneration #buildings are getting one year older too. I photographed the National Fly flying past #Chinatown on its way to the #ndp2018 @ndpeeps Preview 2 last Saturday and Iâ€™d like to think that the Chinook was saluting the pieces of #heroicarchitecture like #pearlbankapartments and #peoplesparkcomplex our Pioneer generation buildings. .
