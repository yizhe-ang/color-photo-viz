Viewed straight on from the East, the new State Courts Tower actually sits directly behind Peopleâ€™s Park Centre and not Furama which is actually adjacent to it.

The new State Courts Tower is designed by @chrislee.serie and his team at Serie Architects with Multiply Architects. Executive Architects are CPG Consultants.
