Originally opened on 5 November 1988 just 2 days shy of the MRT's first anniversary in Singapore, Jurong East MRT station is today one of Singapore's most crowded and well-used MRT stations because it serves as the terminus for the NS Line and also is an interchange station with the EW Line. 

The design of the MRT station was conceptualised by architect Scott Danielson of Parsons Brinckerhoof, the design consultant for Phase IIB of the MRT. Danielson is the man responsible for the ethnic themed MRT station designs like Eunos and Chinese Garden but for Jurong East, he chose to follow the existing red space-frame roof of the new Bus Interchange that had recently been built in 1985 and used the same space-frame red roof for the station. 

Today, the Jurong East Bus Interchange is no more, but its design remains in the MRT station. In 2011, the Jurong East East Modification Project (JEMP) was completed, adding two new platforms and one new track to the station in order to make peak hour operation smoother. 

Perhaps not surprisingly, the same space-frame red roof was used again. You can see the extension of the station on the left side of this panoramic image.
