Thanks to a tip-off from @parklifesg I managed to head over last night to outside #pearlbankapartments in order to make this photo after every single last resident had vacated and handed over their keys by 1700hrs yesterday. The sole light in this image belongs to the common public toilet on level 28, Pearl Bank’s void deck in the sky. Good night and good bye Pearl Bank, it’s been a blast. .
