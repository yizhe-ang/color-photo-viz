I don’t see myself as a rah rah patriot of any sort, and can be sceptical of straightforward symbolic imagery often employed but one thing is for sure - I love the country I was born and grew up in. In this aspect, I think my photographs speak for themselves. 

I feel very strongly for our built heritage, from the most majestic of icons from times past to the most vernacular of public housing blocks. 

This August, I have a lot to be thankful for. 

I am thankful that in the midst of the COVDI19 pandemic, I still have a job to call my own and that my clients are still here, still believing in the power and utility of photographs. I am grateful for the many arts and cultural institutions in this country whom I have had the honour and privilege of working with many times - grateful that during these trying times, they have stepped forward with commissions, funds and grants for groups and individuals like myself in the creative industries in order for us not to go hungry. 

As ten of Singapore’s National Monuments and cultural institutions in the civic district gets a special red and white National Day light-up this August to celebrate National Day, I have chosen to photograph the National Museum of Singapore - built in 1887, an institution which has a special place in my heart for the work I do and which I have had a close working relationship with for nearly two decades. 

Thank you, and Happy 55th National Day @natmuseum_sg !
