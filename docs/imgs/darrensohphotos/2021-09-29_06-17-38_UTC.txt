Even the pattern on the grilles of the parapet wall at block 68 Toa Payoh Lorong 5 were designed like the holes in the ventilation blocks used at the lift lobbies.

Built in 1966 as part of the first batch of flats completed in Toa Payoh, Block 68 is T-shaped and comprises 240 flats in total, with 11 3-room flats and 229 2-room flats.

This image was made with the Wide Angle camera of the iPhone 13 Pro Max, which I strongly believe to be the best camera @apple has ever built for the iPhone in terms of image quality.
