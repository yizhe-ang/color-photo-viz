#peoplesparkcomplex has become such an instagrammed location that it is more associated with #hipster s today than a fine piece of #metabolist #architecture Because of poor drainage, the #rooftop #carpark often experiences ponding especially in the #monsoon and this view has been captured frequently by more and more people. Iâ€™ve been photographing there for over 10 years and last night I decided to try it with the iPhone X. This was made on the #procamera app in #longexposure Lux+ mode.  #sgarchitecture #singaporearchitecture #archdaily #archivingsg #architecture #architecturesg #architecturelovers #architecturephotography #architectureporn #sglandscape #sgcityscape #cityscape #iphoneonly #shotoniphonex #iphonearchitecture
