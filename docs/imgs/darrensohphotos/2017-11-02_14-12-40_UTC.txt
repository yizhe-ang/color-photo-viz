So the #iphonex is officially launching here in #singapore in a few hours and I’ve had one to photograph with and torture test in the last four days. Tonight, in a final round of tests, I put the phone’s camera and it’s new #telephoto 2x lens through some rough situations and I must say the images have been something I could not even dream of getting on a mobile phone camera just a couple of years ago. Technology is amazing!  #sgarchitecture #singaporearchitecture #archdaily #archivingsg #architecture #architecturesg #architecturelovers #architecturephotography #architectureporn #sglandscape #sgcityscape #cityscape #iphoneonly #shotoniphonex
