Paul Rudolph was born on October 23 1918 in Elkton, Kentucky and if he were still alive today he would have just turned 100. Today’s three images are shared from my personal project documenting the last of Rudolph’s great projects - all located in South East Asia, two in Singapore and two in Indonesia, located in Jakarta and Surabaya. This is the Intiland Tower in Surabaya which was completed in 1997, months after Rudolph’s death in New York City on August 8, 1997. .
