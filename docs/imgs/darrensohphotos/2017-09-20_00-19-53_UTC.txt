Three more images from #surabaya #indonesia this week of the #intilandtower #intilandtowersurabaya by @theinnovatie one of #paulrudolph 's two buildings in the country. Completed in 1997, it was actually only finished after Rudolph's death and he never got to see it. #archdaily #architecture #sparklingsurabaya #architecturelovers #architecturephotography #architectureporn #sonya7rii #sonyalpha #sonyalphaprofessionals @paulrudolphfoundation @archdaily @dezeen
