In January 2019, I had the privilege and honour to photograph the insides of the service reservoir or Clear Water Tank at the Bukit Timah Waterworks for @pubsingapore and @urasingapore Bukit Timah Waterworks is Singaporeâ€™s oldest waterworks built by the colonial government in 1891. Built entirely of bricks imported from Calcutta India due to a shortage of bricks in Singapore at the time of construction, this 130 year old structure remains pristine till today. The waterworks was designed by James MacRitchie who was Singaporeâ€™s Municipal Engineer from 1883 to the time of his death in 1895. You can read more in the link in my bio above ðŸ‘†
