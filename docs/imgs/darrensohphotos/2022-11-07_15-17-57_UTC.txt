Throwback to 2014 when I made this image of Block 19 Jalan Sultan, an image made on the very first Sony Alpha 7R camera with an adapted Canon 70-200 lens. Block 19 was built nearly 50 years ago in 1974 and is a HDB rental block under the Public Rental Housing scheme right from the beginning. Constructed at around the same time as other blocks in Crawford, the block consists of 150 2-room flats spread over 15 of the blockâ€™s 16 storeys. Block 18 that faces it is identical in all ways.
