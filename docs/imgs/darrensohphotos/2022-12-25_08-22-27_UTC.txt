It is Christmas and almost the end of another year. As we take stock of the year, perhaps it is more helpful to dwell on the things we did / discovered / enjoyed than to remind ourselves of our shortcomings though those will inevitably be present. We are, after all, human. At the end of this year, I am experimenting with something fun that is still very much up my alley but at the same time, a little different.

Having studied the HDB’s annual reports in their entirety over the years, the images from the late 1960s to the mid 1970s stand out the most in terms of colour palette. They are unmistakably “vintage” and have a painterly mood to them. I have sometimes wondered what it would be like to emulate this vintage Kodachrome look in contemporary digital images but was always distracted by work to dive deep into it. 

Well, I’ve finally done it to several HDB projects, starting with this one - Block 1 Jalan Kukoh, the second of the HDB’s mixed-use podium / slab complexes, completed in 1969 as part of the Ban Kee Fire site redevelopment at Chin Swee Road. Consisting of a slab block of 2-room rental flats atop a two storey podium where the ground floor is a hawker centre, Block 1 has remained largely unchanged over the last 53 years except for the addition of a lift lobby on its right edge.
