This is an image of the @nationalgallerysingapore that I've waited months to make for the gallery. I usually don't put too much emphasis on the #technical #details of an image but for this view, as much #technique went into making the image as #imagination Because of the lack of distance from the building and the tall #rotunda of the former #supremecourt building, we required a #scissorlift and a ten image stitch to make this work. #panorama #archi #archdaily #archilovers #architect #archivingsg #architecturesg #sgarchitecture #sg #sgig #studiomilou #sonyalphaprofessionals #singapore @studiomilou  006/006
