Block 52 Toa Payoh Lorong 6 is widely regarded and accepted to be the very FIRST public housing block completed in Toa Payoh New Town in 1966.

Truth be told, if it was indeed the first to be completed, it was probably a matter of technicality and was ahead by a matter of weeks or months at the very most over the other blocks. This was really because large parts of Toa Payoh Lorong 5 and 6 were built at the same time and an aerial image of that part of Toa Payoh (which shows block 52 and 51 that is behind it) along with an obviously unfinished block 53 (the Y-shaped block) adorns the cover of the HDB Annual Report from 1966.

Now the interesting thing is this - the lease for block 51 starts in 1983, so its a real red herring if you are searching for the age of block 52 based on start of lease date alone. It was obviously built nearly 20 years before that so my best guess is that block 52 was used as a rental block by the HDB before it was finally sold to the public in 1983.

Today, block 52 has been upgraded along with an amazingly substantial number of blocks from the 1960s that still remain in Toa Payoh, a real walk down memory lane for those who remember it from over 50 years ago.
