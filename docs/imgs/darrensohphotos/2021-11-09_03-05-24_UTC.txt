Upping the ante with a small but significant addition to a composition I’ve done a few times in the past at the broadwalk outside @marinabaysands facing the Singapore skyline across @marinabaysg This image is only made possible if it rains enough before sunset and the rain has to stop before dusk. If it rains and stops too early, the water puddles dry up; if it continues to rain at dusk you get raindrops splashing into the puddles depriving you of a close to perfect reflection. And of course, waiting for someone to walk across the brightly lit Apple Store completes the image. I made this with the new @sonyalpha α7IV and my trusty SEL24f14GM 24mm f1.4 G Master lens which never fails me when shot wide open at f1.4. The camera was (again) millimetres from the water and the AF performed flawlessly.
