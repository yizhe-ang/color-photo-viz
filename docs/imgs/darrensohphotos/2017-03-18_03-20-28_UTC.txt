I spend a lot of time at the @marinabaysg area because of my work so it can get very mind numbing after awhile, but I'm always on the lookout for a more interesting #perspective of things and so I spotted this crossing between #marinabayfinancialcentre and the #marinabay #mrt #station last week during morning rush hour and made this image of commuters going to work. #sg #singapore #sglandscape #landscapesg #topdown #lightandshadow #archivingsg #panorama 003/003
