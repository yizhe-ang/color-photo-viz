Thank you everyone who came back yesterday afternoon for the first of my talks to the public on #BeforeItAllGoes Iâ€™m really glad we spoke candidly about our built heritage and landscape and how we might be able safeguard them. I have another public talk this coming Tuesday at 7.30pm also at @objectifscentre and because of the limited places, please email info@objectifs.com.sg should you wish to register. Thank you everyone! .
