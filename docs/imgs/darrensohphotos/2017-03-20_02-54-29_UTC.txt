Having photographed #hdb #publichousing #facades in #singapore for so many years, some observable #patterns tend to emerge. For one thing, #red facades are more common than you'd imagine and #green ones are actually quite rare. Here's an exercise to pick out and arrange amongst the hundreds I have photographed, facades to be grouped into the #primarycolours of #RGB starting with #Blue followed by #Green and then finally #Red. Each #collage consists of twelve public housing facades. #sgarchitecture #architecture #architecturesg #architecturelovers #architecturephotography #sg #archdaily #patterns #housing #urbanliving
