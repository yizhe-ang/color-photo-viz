This is the #podium area at #yangtzecinema that closed on 29th February 2016. The #cinema had developed a seedy reputation for screening soft porn films catered mainly to older men who would come alone. Operating for 25 years, Yangtze shut for good because #pearlscentre has been acquired by the government to be demolished since the future #northsouthexpressway will be built through the ground. #sgarchitecture #architecturesg #architecture #archivingsg #archi #archilovers #singapore #chinatown #interiors
