Itâ€™s that time of the year again for overt shows of patriotism and in some estates like Toa Payoh, the resident committees and town councils look like they are in a competition to outdo each other. This is Toa Payoh North where one of TWO of the OTHER remaining dragon playgrounds resides. This one is smaller than the large one at Lorong 5 and is well, given a lot lesser attention.

I will be sharing my photography documenting Singapore and the concept of home for Today At Apple on 10 August 2019, 1600hrs - 1800hrs. Sign up link in my bio.
