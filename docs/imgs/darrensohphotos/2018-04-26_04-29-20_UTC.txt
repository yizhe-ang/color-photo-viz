Two days ago, I posted images from the #monkshill estate of these #flats built some 60 over years ago and wrongly identified them as built by the #singaporeimprovementtrust It appears they were instead the work of the #singapore Municipal Council and built for public servants. Nevertheless they share the same design as #SIT flats from the same era and most importantly are still not conserved despite them being the only ones of their kind left. .
