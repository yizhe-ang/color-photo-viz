This is 160 Mei Ling Street, Queenstown, the FIRST point block completed by the HDB in 1969 and sold to the public in 1970. Consisting of 3 and 4 room flats, the block is 20-storeys tall.

Along with block 161 which sits adjacent to 160, they are the only two point blocks of this typology in Singapore. They came about at a time when the rapidly growing middle class wanted more privacy even in public housing.

Interesting, each block actually consists of three individual lift landings unconnected to each other, ensuring that every floor only had four units. Three of these units were 3-room flats with one 4-room flat per floor per stack.
