The monsoon brings many challenges to the work I do but also gives me many opportunities to make wet wet wet images like this one.

Older open air car parks often experience some level of ponding in this rainy weather and when Mother Nature gives you water, you make the best use of it.

I made this photo of block 34 Upper Cross Street and its reflection from the open air carpark of Peopleâ€™s Park Centre in between downpours on Friday night.

The block is notoriously difficult to photograph in order to make it stand out because of many other buildings around it.

It was built in 1974 as part of the Park Road and Chin Swee redevelopment where all the blocks in the vicinity had 3 to 4 storey podiums built below them to house shops that shopkeepers who had been relocated from their demolished shophouses could take up in order to continue their trade.

Consisting originally of 320 3-room flats sitting on top of three floors of shops, block 34 is a 20-storey tall slab block with three distinct segments, making it one of the longest HDB blocks still in existence today.
