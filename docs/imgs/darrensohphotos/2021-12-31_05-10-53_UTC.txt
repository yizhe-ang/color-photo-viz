My last few posts this last day of 2021 will be of remembrance and hope and I'd like to start with an image of this building - Highpoint, a private residential development completed in 1974 designed by Kumpulan Akitek. 

On 28 July 2021, one of the founders of Kumpulan Akitek Victor Chew, known professionally as C. A. V. Chew, passed away at the age of 93. Victor was one of Singapore's pioneer architects and Kumpulan Akitek was responsible for many iconic buildings in Singapore, a large number which unfortunately have been demolished. Hilltops and Cairnhill Mansion in the vicinity of Highpoint were all designed by Kumpulan Akitek and have all been collectively sold and redeveloped.

The same fate would have befallen Highpoint as it too was sold earlier this month on 9th December to Hong Kong's Shun Tak Holdings to be redeveloped. However, the @mndsingapore announced a slew of property cooling measures on 15th December 2021 one of which was the increase in buyer ABSD from 25(+5)% to 35(+5)% for entities. Shun Tak had already paid a small deposit of 1 million SGD which they then forfeited on 23th December 2021, which means Highpoint remains unsold and is safe from demolition for now.

Highpoint is special because no other residential complex was designed like it and none have come after like it too. Perhaps there is still chance to rehabilitate the property instead of going the more environmentally destructive route of demolishing it and building anew.

One can hope.
