These #hdb #publichousing flats on #jurongwest st 64 have been photographed by many people because of the symmetrical void formed by the four blocks. I was in the west yesterday again and the light was great so I used my @oowalife 15mm attachment for the #iphone to make this view. #madewithoowa #shotoniphone7plus #shotoniphone #sgarchitecture #architecturephotography #archivingsg #archdaily #architecture #architecturesg #architecturelovers #singapore
