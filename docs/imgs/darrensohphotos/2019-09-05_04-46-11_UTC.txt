Of late, there has been renewed discussion in Singapore on the “lottery effect” of landing a new HDB Public Housing flat in the central area new directly from the government.

Despite these flats being priced higher than similarly sized units in the suburbs, the prices they can fetch on the resale market after the first occupant’s minimum occupation period (MOP) more than makes up for the initial outlay.

Today we look at block 269B Queen Street, more commonly known as Cheng Yan Court, a block built by the HDB in the Bugis precinct in 1983 and sold to the public in 1984. Cheng Yan Court counts among some of the very last HDB public housing flats built in the central area due to the government stopping all public housing projects in the CBD due to the impending arrival of the MRT and to free up land for developments of higher value. This policy was only reversed in 2001.

Cheng Yan Court consists of a mix of 3-room (67-68 sqm) and 4-room (92 sqm) flats, and most recently, some of the 4-room flats have transacted in the resale market for over $700k - on a flat with about 63 years left on its lease.

There is no quick and fast solution to this, as the market tends to decide what it wants and gets.
