When I first started to photograph in dark and unfamiliar places all over Singapore in 2003, I had no idea that those images I made would come to define me as a photographer.

Born out of a curiosity of the unknown, as well as a young photographer’s restlessness, While You Were Sleeping grew to say as much about our country as it did of me.

Eighteen years, two books and two exhibitions later, Singapore is now a very different place. Many of the locations I visited in the early 2000s, once alien, are now completely transformed.

Join us next week on 31 March 2021 as we bring you While You Were Sleeping - The Documentary.

The trailer for this film directed by @ieremv and coproduced by him and me is in the next post.

This image was made in 2003 in the Lim Chu Kang Cemetery of a tree I have come to call “the Singapore tree” because of its uncanny resemblance to the outline of Singapore.
