Stage 3 of the @ltasg â€˜s Thomson Eastcoast Line (TEL) officially opens to the public on 13 Nov after many years of planning and delays due to the pandemic. Stage 3 has a bumper crop of 11 stations that spans Stevens (TE11) to Gardens By The Bay (TE22). 

I had the chance to photograph at Gardens By The Bay Station last week - here are the images of a station that will become iconic not just because of its location but also its clamshell design. Probably drawing influences from the double domes of the Gardens, the station is designed by @aedas_architects and features a double green wall on its interior leading up from concourse to ground level. 

The station features the Art In Transit piece PLANTING SHADOWS by Fiona Koh / @vert_sub 

Do check out all stations on 11 Nov when the TEL3 has its open house free ride day!
