It's #qingming #qingming2017 or the annual #TombSweepingDay (month really) for the #chinese and #limchukang #cemetery is where all the action is as families descend upon the #chinesecemetery to burn #josssticks #papermoney and #offerings to their departed. As I photographed this, I wonder how long this #tradition will go on for in #singapore as the leases for cemetery  #plots become shorter and shorter in this #landscarce #country and more and more people are encouraged to opt for #cremation instead of #burial #sglandscape #landscapesg #landscapephotography #nightphotography #nocturnal #sonya7rii #sonyalphaprofessionals
