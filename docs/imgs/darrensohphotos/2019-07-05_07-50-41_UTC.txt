Completed in 1977 with a lease starting from 1978, block 219 Toa Payoh Lorong 8 has, together with the other blocks in the smallish neighbourhood it finds itself in, an interesting electoral life in the sense that while it is physically located firmly in Toa Payoh, it belongs to the Potong Pasir Single Member Constituency Ward. The Neighbourhood has recently been repainted in rather pleasant pink and purple pastel shades.
