This is another view of #Queenstowncinema and bowl which I photographed between 2012-2013 just before it was demolished and also during its demolition. The cinema complex was designed by #cheesoonwah from #cheesoonwaharchitects and completed in 1977. Originally finished entirely in red brick, it is said that the architect was inspired by #alvaraalto and incorporated the strong geometry that was synonymous with the Finnish master. Other works by Chee Soon Wah includes the #textilecentre and #bukittimahshoppingcentre .
