This year will mark the tenth anniversary of some important projects in my photography life - some of which have never been published. Like this one - the documentation of the last days of the National Library building at Stamford Road up till its closure and demolition in 2004. #library #nationallibrary #nationalmonument #sgmemory #singapore #architecture #urbanism #cityscape #landscape #urbanliving #singaporelandscape #singaporearchitecture #sgbuilding #sgarchitecture #sglandscape
