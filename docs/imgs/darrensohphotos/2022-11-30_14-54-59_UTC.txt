Iâ€™ve always said that I am an opportunistic photographer who tries to cram as many locations into one given morning or afternoon because the quality of light I want for my images is so fleeting. This image of Rochor Centre was made in the span of a 15min session I managed to squeeze in between appointments and was previously published in Before It All Goes. It lives again in EVERYDAY MODERNISM. Rochor Centre remains the ONLY HDB mixed use podium / tower complex in the CBD that has been demolished.

Remember, TODAY is the last day you can use the discount code MODERN20 to grab your copy from the NUS Press webstore and at the point of writing this there is but a little over an hour left! Link in BIO above ðŸ‘†
