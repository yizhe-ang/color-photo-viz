It rained almost the whole of yesterday and this morning the air was still very damp from the downpour. I made this photo of #johor from #sembawangpark at about 730am and you can make out the mist still enveloping a large part of the #landscape across the straits. #malaysia #neighbour #sonearyetsofar #my #mylandscape #landscapephotography #sglandscape #landscapesg #iphoneonly #shotoniphone7plus
