More arches and semi circular motifs.

One of my regrets as an archivist of public housing in Singapore is that I never properly photographed most of the HUDC estates that have no longer exist today.

Despite the fact that the flats on offer were largely identical across different estates, the HDB designers that worked on each estate would add same unique touches in every estate such as the arches in Hougang N7 / Florence Regency.

These features made them stand out from each other and served as a form of identity marker for each estate.
