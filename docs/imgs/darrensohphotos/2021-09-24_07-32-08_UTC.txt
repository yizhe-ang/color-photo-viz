The @apple iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro series have landed!

I’ve had the chance to use mine for the past three days taking full advantage of this amazing weather we’ve had here in Singapore to push the iPhones to their limit. The new iPhones all have improved cameras and it really shows in the images I have made. 

This is another image of block 82 Commonwealth Close, which counts itself among the very first batch of HDB flats sold to the public in 1964. I lived there from 1976 till 1981 and go back to make images of it whenever I have a new camera.

This image is of the same facade as my earlier shot and this one was made on the 1x Wide Angle Camera of the iPhone which now spots a larger sensor with a pixel size of 1.9µm and a tad slightly bigger aperture size of f1.5 vs f1.6 previously found in the iPhone 12 Pro Max. In terms of absolute image quality, the 1x camera is probably the best of the lot.
