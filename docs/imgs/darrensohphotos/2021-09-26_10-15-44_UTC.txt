When Night Mode was first introduced to the iPhone 2 years ago with the iPhone 11 series, it suddenly allowed us to see in the dark but sometimes the results were unpredictable and tones would be lost in the final image.

With the iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max’s new Wide Angle camera and larger sensor as well as Apple ProRAW, making images such as this one at dusk have become reality.

This is an image of Kreta Ayer Complex, a HDB public housing mixed-use complex with residential blocks sitting atop a commercial podium known as Chinatown Complex Hawker Centre. The yellow and green building in the background is the iconic People’s Park Complex and the sunset three nights ago was absolutely stunning.
