The new @Apple @marinabaysands store opens tomorrow 10 September.

As far as I am aware, this is the only Apple store in the world with escalators inside the store, and they have to be experienced in person for the total reveal of the sphere as you make your way up from the underground avenue. In my opinion, the best order to move through the store is to enter at B2 and then emerge from the escalators into the sphere.

I had an exclusive opportunity to photograph the store for @designandarchitecturemag and the piece is now live! Link to the story is in my bio.
