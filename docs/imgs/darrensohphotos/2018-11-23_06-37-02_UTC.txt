November is the @urasingapore ‘s Architectural Heritage Season and I’ll be highlighting @myqueenstown ‘s most beloved #church the #blessedsacramentchurch on Commonwealth Drive with three symmetrical images. This last image had me lying on the floor of the church pointing my camera straight up toward the center of the cruciform. .
