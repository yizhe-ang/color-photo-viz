This is Block 271 #queenstreet which sits on top of #albertcentre at the #Rochor #Bugis precinct in #singapore Two things about this image - firstly the block isn’t actually red - the redness came from the bright lights from the neighbouring OG Shopping Centre’s signboard and secondly this view is sadly no longer possible because it was made from Block 1 #rochorcentre that is about to be demolished.
