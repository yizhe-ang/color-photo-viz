For the past week, I've been thwarted by the #weather almost every day at some point when I needed to make pictures for work so I've decided to post a trio of #badweather images made over the past year, perhaps to ward off more bad weather this week? In any case, as I've mentioned, when the sky throws you lemons, made lemonade. #sglandscape #sgarchitecture #architecturesg #landscapesg #landscapephotography #stormchaser #stormchasers #storm #tropicalstorm #singapore #archivingsg #archdaily #architecturelovers #architecture #landscape #architecturephotography #cityscape #cityscapephotography
