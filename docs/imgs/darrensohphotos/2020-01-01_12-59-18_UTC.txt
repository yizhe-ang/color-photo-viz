In what seems to be a scene from the apocalypse, one of the highlights of every new year is the launching of flares from the ships anchored off the coast of Singapore at the stroke of midnight. I’m unsure of how the tradition began, but it’s been going on for as long as I remember. This morning, I was happy to be able to photograph BOTH the fireworks and the flares from my vantage point at Changi.
