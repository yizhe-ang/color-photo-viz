@jewelchangiairport opens on April 17 and public previews begin on April 11. This is possibly #singapore ‘a most anticipated project of 2019 boasting the world’s tallest indoor waterfall, lush indoor gardens and a huge destination mall. Very Singaporean indeed! Jewel is designed by @safdiearchitects and executive architects are @rsparchitects It is built by @wohhupgroup I made this image from the port side window seat of an aircraft taking off from @changiairport .
