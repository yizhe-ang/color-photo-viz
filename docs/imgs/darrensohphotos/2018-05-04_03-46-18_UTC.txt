I have been as guilty as any other photographer who concentrated on photographing block 9 #selegiehouse mostly in the month of August when its entire #facade is decked out fully with national flags. However there is so much more to Selegie House than just an instagrammable facade. .

Selegie House was completed in 1963 and one of the #hdb â€˜s first urban renewal projects in the central part of #singapore It has been upgraded since, but remains standing tall after 55 years. .
