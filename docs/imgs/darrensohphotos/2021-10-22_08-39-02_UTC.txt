This is the Thomson Nature Park, the site of a former Hainan village full of Durian and Rambutan Trees. The trails in the Park follows the roads of the former village and the park is also home to the endangered Raffles' Banded Langur.

One of the draws of the Nature Park is a REAL stream that runs through the park. The banks of the stream have probably been landscaped by the @nparksbuzz but we appreciate the light touch approach!
