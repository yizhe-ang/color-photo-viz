Photographing at the #NAKA #Phuket today for #Condenast #China, the last leg of my assignment on the island. This image shows one of the #villas. Designed by Thai #architect Duangrit Bunnag, every villa is built on a #cantilever box that affords panoramic views of the #Andaman Sea. #thailand #designhotels #archdaily #architecture
