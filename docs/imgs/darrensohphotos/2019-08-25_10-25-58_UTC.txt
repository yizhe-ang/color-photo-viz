Completed in 1965, Block 37 Circuit Road was the largest block in what was then MacPherson Road (South) Estate. 
Comprising of 570 dwelling units, the block has a mixture of sold and rental flats with the following breakdown as of 2019:

1. 95 3-Room flats that are owned,
2. 1 4-Room flat that is owned (likely 2 3-room flats combined by one owner),
3. 452 2-Room rental flats and
4. 22 3-Room rental flats.

At one point, Block 37 was THE largest HDB Block in Singapore by dwelling units but that has since been surpassed by Block 52 Cassia Crescent completed in 2016 which boasts 584 dwelling units.

The HDB was obviously very proud of Block 37 when it was first built because in its Annual Report from 1965, photographs of the block appear several times. The block was part of the HDB's Phase II development of MacPherson Road Estate where the Board started to build 3-room flats in addition to 1-room and 2-room units which were all that they built in Phase I.

There used to be a large playground in front of Block 37 when it was built in 1965 and this playground lasted till 1976 when more car park space was required and the space was converted into a surface carpark which has remained till today.

Because the MacPherson HDB estate is older than Toa Payoh and actually predates Singapore's independence from Malaya, it is an area with many many stories to be told.
