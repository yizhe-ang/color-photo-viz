I spend a large amount of my work life photographing #construction sites, and while it is very hard work (#hardhat + #safetyharness + #safetyboots + #cameras ) the rewards usually only reveal themselves years after the shoots. This is because a building is only under construction ONCE in its life, and it will never look that way again. This image of #reflectionsatkeppelbay  by #daniellibeskind @daniellibeskind was made in 2010 with the #towercrane s still in place and I just realized that the towers would never look like this again. #sgarchitecture #architecturesg #archivingsg #architecture #architecturelovers #architecturephotography #landscape #landscapephotography #sglandscape #landscapesg #blastfromthepast #throwback
