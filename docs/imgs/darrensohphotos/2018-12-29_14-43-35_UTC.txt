John Portman, neofuturist architect and developer, passed away exactly one year ago today on 29 Dec 2017. Portman was 93. Having pioneered the typology of the #atriumhotel Portman first brought the concept out of America in 1982 with @johnportmanassoc â€˜s first commission in #Singapore - the Intercontinental Pavilion that would later be renamed the @regentsingapore Today I share three images of that amazing atrium at the Regent in memory of Portman, and a reminder that the next time you step into a hotel with a soaring atrium, there is a good chance it might be a Portman or someone inspired by him. .
