Today, I’d like to draw some attention to an architect named #cheesoonwah Chee Soon Wah designed the former #Queenstowncinema and bowl, a complex built in 1977, closed in 1999 and demolished in 2013. The former cinema is included in my show #BeforeItAllGoes as seen here. Little is known today about this prolific architect who designed many many of our buildings including the #textilecentre #bukittimahshoppingcentre #fortunecentre and #sultanplaza He also used to work with BOTH the #designpartnership and worked on #peoplesparkcomplex AND also worked with  #gohhockguan on #goldenmiletower Amazing isn’t it? .
