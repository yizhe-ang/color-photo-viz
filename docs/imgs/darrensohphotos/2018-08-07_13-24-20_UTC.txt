#BeforeItAllGoes opens at @objectifscentre in exactly two weeks and the exhibition images are being printed right now. I will be showing a total of 92 images made in the last decade of threatened buildings in #singapore including this wall of 48 #hdb #facades from blocks built in the 1960s and 1970s. This is a full scale #panorama showing the size of the collage. Before It All Goes is designed by @abigaeltay and her team at #obllique and the accompanying monograph is designed by @randy__yeo and @practice.theory The accompanying documentary is filmed and produced by @ieremv and @runandgunsg See you all on the 21st of August 7pm!
