This morningâ€™s work brought me back into the #cbd in #singapore where it is always a challenge to photograph tall buildings since they are all so close to each other. After my shoot, I noticed this scene of reflections framing #oneshentonway a developer completed earlier this decade by @citydevelopments and designed by #carlosott When completed, it was the tallest condominium along #shentonway and it still stands out today because of its distinct gold finishing.
