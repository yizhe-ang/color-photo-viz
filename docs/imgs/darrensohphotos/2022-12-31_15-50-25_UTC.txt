In the final few hours of 2022, I’d like to share some new territory (literally and metaphorically) I want to move into for the new year professionally that I attempted in the days before Christmas. 

The architectural histories of Singapore and Malaysia are inextricably intertwined and this is an area I’d really love to explore more in this coming year. 

This is the Masjid Negeri Seremban, the State Mosque of Negri Sembilan located in Seremban. I photographed it one beautiful morning just before Christmas and ticked off an item on my bucket list by doing so. 

Completed in 1967, the Masjid Negeri Seremban was the first mosque in Malaysia designed by a partnership of ethnic Chinese architects - the Malayan Architects Co-Partnership (MAC) of Lim Chong Keat, William SW Lim and Chen Voon Fee. It was then seen to completion by Dato’ Baharuddin Abu Kassim of Jurubena Bertiga, the successor of MAC and better known to most Singaporeans as Architects Team 3. 

Consisting of nine pillars with nine concrete conoids representing the nine historic districts of Negeri Sembilan, the mosque was a mix of modernism with Minangkabau influences. 

The beautiful roof form of the mosque is unique and was groundbreaking at the point of construction, made possible with structural engineering from @arupgroup This was one of Ove Arup & Partners very first projects in Malaysia, having set up an office in the country only in 1964. 

I hope to spend some time in 2023 and beyond photographing more pieces of modern architecture in Malaysia and explore the connections that many of the architects had between Singapore and Malaysia. 

Happy New Year!
Selamat Tahun Baru!
