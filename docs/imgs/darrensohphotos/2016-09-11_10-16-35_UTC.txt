I used to do some #drone #photography on my own but I've realised I'm a terrible pilot so these days I leave the flying to other folks like @weixianglimsg however I'm still fascinated with the #topdown #perspective which can be achieved in other ways like this image I was in #toapayohlor1 of a really old #hdb #publichousing #block that is now spankingly bright thanks to #ledlights that have been installed. #architecturesg #sgarchitecture #architecturelovers #architecture #archdaily #toapayoh #vernacular #sonyalphaprofessionals #sonya7rii
