This is block 51 Kent Road, in the Owen / Norfolk / Cambridge Road area of #singapore where is there is a very interesting mix of public housing and some really handsome old buildings. The area is more well known for the good food at the Pek Kio Hawker Centre though but the buildings are most definitely worth checking out. This #hdb #publichousing block was completed in 1982. .
