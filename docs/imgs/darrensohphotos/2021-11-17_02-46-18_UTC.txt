Here is a more “common” vantage point of People’s Park Complex shot with the new @sonyalpha A7IV with the SEL1224GM. Using the new flip screen available only on the A7IV and  the Sony A7SIII, I could zoom and compose this scene as tight as I wanted it and more accurately than ever before with my camera just above the puddle.
