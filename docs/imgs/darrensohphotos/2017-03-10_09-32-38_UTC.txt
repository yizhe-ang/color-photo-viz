Now we have the #blue #block block 2 #rochorcentre As part of my #tribute to the complex with a series of #panorama images depicting the #facade of each block in their #primarycolour paint schemes. The blocks will be accessible till May 2017 then they will be cordoned off and eventually demolished. #architecture #archdaily #architecturephotography #architecturelovers #architecturesg #sgarchitecture #archivingsg #hdb #enbloc #publichousing #rgb #rgby 002/003
