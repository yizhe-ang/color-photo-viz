Every time we manage to stick an #airplane in the middle of a symmetrical #image we get told jokes about the "Nikon Airplane". Honestly, it isn't difficult to get the real deal, #aircraft #landingpatterns are fixed, depending on the wind, they can only approach from either ends of the runway. You just need to draw an extended line on #googlemaps from the runway to know what the airplane will fly over. The rest is a lot of patience and some luck. üòÅ incidentally I was really here to photograph the two old #hdb #publichousing blocks that will be demolished soon. I happened to run into a @thersaf #kc135r #stratotanker coming in to land at #tengahairbase #architecture #archdaily #architecturephotography #architecturesg #sgarchitecture #symmetry #nophotoshop  #sonya7rii #sonyalphaprofessionals #voigtlander #voigtlander10mm
