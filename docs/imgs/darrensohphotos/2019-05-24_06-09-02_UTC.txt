Despite being known for three buildings in Singapore, I.M. Pei was in fact also involved in the design of @suntecsingapore @sunteccity together with @tsaomckown as well as @dparchitects I unfortunately have not been able to find out how involved I.M. Pei was with the project and perhaps this is something that @zackmckown could shed some light on? Anyways, here is a more unfamiliar view of the towers of #sunteccity seen next to the beautiful #shawtower by #iversenvansitteren that will be redeveloped by its owners next year.
