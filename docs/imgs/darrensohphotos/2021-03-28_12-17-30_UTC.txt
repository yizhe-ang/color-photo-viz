When I started photographing the project that would become While You Were Sleeping in 2003, the HDB was quickly developing the North Eastern part of Singapore.

Punggol was still relatively secluded with very few blocks completed and even Sengkang East (todayâ€™s Fernvale) was still largely a gigantic construction site with some very very new flats promising homes for thousands of Singaporeans.

2003 was also the year @objectifscentre was born and it shares the same birth year as While You Were Sleeping.

Thus is it more than apt that 18 years later, we will be premiering While You Were Sleeping - The Documentary directed by @ieremv this coming Wednesday 31 March on the Objectifs YouTube channel. Do join us!

This image made in 2003 shows the former Jalan Kayu in the background. The historical road has since been re-routed.
