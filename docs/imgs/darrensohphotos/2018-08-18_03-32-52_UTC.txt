In conjunction with the launch of my book and exhibition #BeforeItAllGoes at @objectifscentre on 21 Aug, I am offering a very limited tote bag emblazoned with 50 #HDB #publichousing #facades of flats built in the 1960s and 1970s for sale. The bag measures 40cm x 33cm and will be on sale at SGD25 each.

Unfortunately the first shipment of the bag has all been snapped up but a new shipment will arrive week of 27 Aug. If you’d like to reserve one, you can make payment first to the following accounts and I will be in touch once the bags are ready for pickup at @objectifscentre .
