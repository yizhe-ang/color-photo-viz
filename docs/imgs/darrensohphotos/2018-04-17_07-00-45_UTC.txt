Another SEVENTY #hdb #publichousing #facades from #singapore . Over the last twelve years I have photographed hundreds of them and I’m nowhere near done. There are some 10,000 HDB blocks in existence and every five years they are repainted in new colours. I will be sharing some of my work on photographing public housing next Saturday 28th April 4pm at Apple Orchard Road. Details in my profile! .
