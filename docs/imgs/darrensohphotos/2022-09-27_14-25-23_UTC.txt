Here is a classic view of People’s Park Complex from the outside, one of the few angles that clearly shows on the thin slab seats on that massive podium to form a “city in a building” as the metabolist architects dreamt of. This image was shot with the iPhone 14 Pro Max’s main 48MP wideangle camera and cropped to square - and I still have 36MP left after!
