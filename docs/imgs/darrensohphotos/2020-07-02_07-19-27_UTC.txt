Here’s yet another election rally ground from GE2015 that no longer exists.

On 7 September 2015, the @wpsgp held a rally in an empty field at Ubi. At that rally, they warned of the danger of a one party system in parliament - where the proverbial “blank cheque” will be used to push through policies and laws with next to no resistance.

That field is today a construction site, where a large new HDB Public Housing estate - Ubi Grove, is currently being built.

I have once wondered last GE where rallies would be held in the next GE as more and more open spaces become construction sites, and I guess the answer we have this COVID19 pandemic season is - nowhere.
