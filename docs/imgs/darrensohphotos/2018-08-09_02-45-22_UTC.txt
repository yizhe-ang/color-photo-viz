Dear Singapore, 
I see that on the occasion of your 53rd Birthday, you have chosen to employ the use of some endangered species as well as resurrect one dead animal from beyond the grave for this year's National Day Parade. 
I wonder why the "heritage" playgrounds have become such icons? A remembrance of time gone by perhaps or maybe the realisation that we should have conserved more of them?

Instead we find ourselves in a situation where there are only two large Dragons left, the one in Toa Payoh being the sole surviving one that still has a sand pit around it. Meanwhile, there are more Doves in Johor Bahru than there are in Singapore, with the lone survivor in Dakota Crescent having only recently been spared demolition. 
And now, we are putting them (along with the long deceased Pelican) on floats and parading them for NDP2018.

Don't get me wrong, I am all FOR celebrating the heritage playgrounds, but did we really have to wait until they were almost completely wiped out before we decided that they were worth keeping? 
You really don't miss something until its gone eh Singapore?

Last evening, I photographed the Animal Playground floats as they sat silently in captivity along Nicoll Highway - waiting to be used one last time this evening in a show of celebration. 
In the background, you can JUST make out the yellow roof of Golden Mile Tower - its fate yet to be determined by a collective sales committee waiting for the right price. Similar fates await Golden Mile Complex, People's Park Complex and many other buildings built at the same time as the animal playgrounds. 
Perhaps we will next see Pearl Bank on a float in an upcoming NDP a couple of years down the road - by which time of course it would be too late. 
Happy 53rd Birthday.
Majulah, Singapura.
