This morning I had the opportunity to visit #pasirpanjang "A" #powerstation as part of the #SLASecretSpaces series of tours organised by @singaporelandauthority and @jeronimoloco it was really amazing to go inside the decommissioned station and experience the space. Thank you for the opportunity! #heritage #archivingsg #redbrick #modernist #singapore #sgarchitecture #archdaily #architecture #architecturesg #architecturelovers #architecturephotography #shotoniphone7plus #madewithoowa @oowalife #shotoniphone
