In researching all of the HDB's flat types and the blocks which contain them, the most confusing typology to find information on must be the HDB Maisonette.

This is really because there were not one, not two but three categories of maisonettes. For starters, HDB maisonettes came in two flavours - the 5-Room maisonette at 135 sqm and the executive maisonette at 148 sqm in size.

In fact the first HDB maisonettes to be conceived and built were not HDB maisonettes, yes I typed that right. This was because of the existence of the now defunct Housing and Urban Development Company (HUDC) which was created by the HDB in the early 1970s to cater for the growing affluent middle class. Thus, the first maisonettes built by the HDB were for the HUDC and were located at the now demolished Amberville (what is today's Silversea condo) and they were completed in two phases - the first being in 1978.

The very first high-rise HDB 5-room maisonettes to be announced by the HDB were the ones in this image I made - at Block 60 Dakota Crescent. They were scheduled for completion in end 1981 and were most certainly completed by 1983 as they have an official lease start date of October 1983. They were however mentioned significantly in newspaper reports in 1981, so they were either delayed or were not handed over to residents immediately after completion.

In any case, block 60 Dakota Crescent is a HUGE block that is roughly U-shaped and consists of 134 5-room maisonettes and oddly, 28 4-room flats.

When they were first sold to the public, the flats cost SGD 112,800. These days, they transact for close to a 1 million dollars, with every single unit for sale at over SGD 900,000 on the resale market.
