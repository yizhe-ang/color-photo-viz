These old #hdb blocks at #commonwealthdrive are scheduled to be demolished before the year is up, adding to one more thing we would have lost this #SG50 There is an open house this weekend 3rd October from 11am onwards where members of the public can access one of the blocks for the last time. There will also be a photo exhibition by @nickyloh #architecture #archdaily #archivingsg #sg #sgarchitecture #sgig #sgmemory #modernism #publichousing
