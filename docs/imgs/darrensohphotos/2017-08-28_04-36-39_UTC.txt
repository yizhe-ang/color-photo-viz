Here's another #shoutout to @dparchitects on the occasion of their #50thanniversary Much of #singapore was designed by #dparchitects including the iconic #peoplesparkcomplex and #goldenmilecomplex which are my #favourite #buildings in this country. Here are three images exemplifying what might be the original #mixused concept in Singapore, with a #commercial #podium at its base and #offices and #residences above it. #metabolism #metabolist #metabolistarchitecture #taykhengsoon #williamlim #ganengoon #sgarchitecture #archdaily #archivingsg #architecturesg #architecture #architecturelovers #architecturephotography #modernist #modernism #sonya7rii #sonyalphaprofessionals
