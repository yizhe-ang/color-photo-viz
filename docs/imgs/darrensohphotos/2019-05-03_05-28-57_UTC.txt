This #panorama starts from Outram Road on the left with a clearly inhabited #pearlbankapartments and ends on the right at Singaporeâ€™s CBD. I made this image in 2016 when #pearlcentre had been vacated but not yet demolished. It also shows the whole extant of #Chinatown as we know it and other landmarks like #peoplesparkcomplex .
