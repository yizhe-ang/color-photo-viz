It is #impei 's #100th birthday today and I'm going to be using my #insta panel of three images today to celebrate his three projects in #singapore in chronological order. We're starting with #ocbccentre which was his first project here and completed in #1976 Still standing today, the #building is an understated #modernist beauty. #archivingsg #archdaily #architecture #architecturesg #architecturelovers #architecturephotography #arup @ocbcbank #sgarchitecture
