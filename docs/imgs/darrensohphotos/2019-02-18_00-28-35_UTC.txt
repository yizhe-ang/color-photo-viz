Bishan New Town was another of the HDB’s second generation new towns, first conceived in 1979 when the government acquired land that was originally the largest Chinese cemetery in Singapore - the Kwong Wai Siew Peck San Teng (广惠肇碧山亭; Guanghuizhao bishanting), a cemetery that dates back to 1870 meant in the early days for the Cantonese and Hakka community and then later for all Chinese in Singapore. .
.
In the 1980s, the HDB started developing the cemetery and also resettled the residents from Kampong San Teng and Soon Hock Village, two major villages in the area. .
.
Bishan New Town was planned as four neighbourhoods - Bishan East (where Junction 8, Sky Habitat and the part of Bishan closest to Toa Payoh is today), Bishan North (the part of Bishan with the ubiquitous terracotta red brick facades joined to Bishan Park), Bishan West (today’s Sin Ming estate) and Shunfu Estate. Shunfu Estate was the first to be completed followed by the rest of Bishan. .

This image is one I made at dawn of Bishan North, where you can see the unique architecture of the estate not found in other parts of Singapore as well as a part of Bishan Park, today known as Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park, probably renamed because it forms the boundary line between Bishan and Ang Mo Kio. .
.
Interestingly, despite the fact that Bishan used to be the site of Singapore’s largest Chinese cemetery, it has become really hot in terms of property prices and is now one of the most expensive HDB estates in Singapore. .
