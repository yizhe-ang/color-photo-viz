Blocks 74-80 Commonwealth Drive were famous for being the first HDB flats to be featured on Singapore currency - the Orchid Series one dollar note. Like many other parts of Commonwealth / Queenstown, the flats were completed in 1962. They underwent the HDBâ€™s SERS programme following an announcement on the 8th of August 2008 - 8808 and were subsequently demolished in 2016.
