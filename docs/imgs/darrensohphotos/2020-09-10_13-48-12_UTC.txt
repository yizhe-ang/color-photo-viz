Like many Singaporeans, I’m a great fan of Mustafa Centre. This place started its journey as a makeshift shop set up by Mohamed Mustafa and his son to sell ready-made garments on Campbell Lane. Over the years, Mustafa Centre was gradually built up from one shop to two large buildings along Syed Alwi Road. It was only in 2003 that Mustafa Centre became a 24-hour shopping centre, now with some adjustments to its operating hours. Not to worry – you can still buy almost anything there!
 
Take a look at all the spots I have rediscovered over at @STB_SG, and share your favourite part of Mustafa Centre with #SingapoRediscovers.
