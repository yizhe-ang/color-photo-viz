Paul Rudolph was born on October 23 1918 in Elkton, Kentucky and if he were still alive today he would have just turned 100. Today’s three images are shared from my personal project documenting the last of Rudolph’s great projects - all located in South East Asia, two in Singapore and two in Indonesia, located in Jakarta and Surabaya. This is The Colonnade in Singapore, completed in 1986 and the first of his four large projects in the region.
