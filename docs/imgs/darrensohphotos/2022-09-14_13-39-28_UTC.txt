Ladies and Gentlemen, I present to you the iPhone 14 Pro Max, which I have used to make these images today here in Singapore. First impressions? That new 48MP sensor on the 1x Wide Camera is nothing short of amazing - but it does take up a lot of space - each ProRAW DNG file is between 70-80MB in size. 

I also welcome the return of the 2x (48mm equivalent) 12MP Telephoto camera virtually created by cropping into the center of the 48MP Wide Camera. Yes, you can shoot the 2x camera in ProRAW as well and the results are pretty amazing. 

This is Lau Pa Sat, shot this evening with the new Ultra Wide 0.5x camera of the iPhone 14 Pro Max.
