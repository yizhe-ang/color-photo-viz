Did you know the sunshading fins of The Esplanade were not found in the original concept design for the theatres? They were only added later but before construction commenced. Yesterday, 12 October 2022 is the 20th birthday of @esplanadesingapore Officially opened on 12 October 2002, I made this photo of specialised abseiling workers cleaning then brand new sun shading fins of the the two "durians" a month before in September 2002. I shot this image with one of the very first "affordable" DSLRs in the world back then - the Nikon D100. It had a whopping 6 megapixel sensor!
Happy 20th Birthday Esplanade - Theatres on the Bay!
