There has been some unprecedented news that #goldenmilecomplex is being put on the collective sale market while at the same time also undergoing a study for possible conservation. While this is hardly a guarantee that the building will be saved, it is nevertheless a step in an encouraging direction, where further conversations can take place between all stakeholders to strike a balance between urban renewal and saving an old but significant icon. For some reason, this particular image of Golden Mile Complex has become a crowd favourite from all the hundreds of images Iâ€™ve made of it. .
