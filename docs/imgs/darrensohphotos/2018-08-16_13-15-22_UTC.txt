1. Publishing a book is like birthing a baby - there are pains and sometimes scares along the way but ultimately when it finally happens, you feel like a proud parent. .
.
2. Treat every book you publish as if it were your last and put everything into it. Donâ€™t compromise and you will have zero regrets. .
. 
These past three months have flashed past just like that and now, Before It All Goes will open and launch next week. .
.
#BeforeItAllGoes Architecture from Singapore's Early Independence years will be my fifth self-published book. .
