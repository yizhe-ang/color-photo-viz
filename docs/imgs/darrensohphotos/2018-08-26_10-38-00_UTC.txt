Yesterday was the 15th day of the Lunar 7th Month or the date commonly known as the Hungry Ghosts Festival, and the Chinese Cemetery in Lim Chu Kang was a bustle of activity. Here, devotees order burnt offerings to the departed who have been forgotten or neglected by their families as a form of charity or community work, but for the dead. Parts of the cemetery will return to the state in the 2020s for the expansion of Tengah Airbase, so many of these graves will have to be exhumed then. I photograph at the cemetery every year during the lunar 7th month, #beforeitallgoes .
