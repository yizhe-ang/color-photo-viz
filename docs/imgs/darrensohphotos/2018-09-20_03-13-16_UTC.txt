I just got my hands on the #iphoneXSMax yesterday ahead of it’s official launch tomorrow so I have been busy putting it through its paces. Preliminary results from using it for the past 24 hours have been awesome and one of my findings (like other reviewers) have been that the wideangle lens on the XSMax (and probably XS) is wider than that on the #iPhoneX with a rough 26mm FOV (in 35mm full frame terms) as compared to 28mm in the iPhoneX. This is one of my favourite images from this morning #shotoniphonexsmax where I dipped the top of my phone where the lens housing was slightly into the lotus pond at @artsciencemuseumsg to get a shot of both the koi in the pond as well as the #singapore #skyline in one shot. As you may already know, the iPhoneXS Max is IP68 rated, which means it can survive 2m of submergence for up to 30mins. This shot was really made in 5-7cm of water for about 5 secs so I think I’m safe. :)
