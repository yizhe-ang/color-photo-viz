Block 26 Jalan Klinik in Bukit Ho Swee was completed in 1963 after the Bukit Ho Swee Fire of 1961. It is commonly accepted to be the first HDB block in Singapore that had a void deck. Part of this void deck used to house a paediatric clinic and that is how the block got itâ€™s street address. Block 26 is also one of the last few remaining slab blocks in Singapore with a completely porous facade along the side of its common corridors, something that the HDB did away with quite early on.
