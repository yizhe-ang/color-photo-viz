The best #camera is the one you have with you when what you want to #photograph presents itself. This camera just so happened to have a second #lens of an equivalent 56mm #focallength I made this image next to the @singaporeflyer just before #dusk It had rained just before and the sun came out for a moment before it set. The @nea_sg was also doing #mosquito #fogging and added to the #atmosphere #cityscape #landscapesg #cityscapesg #landscapephotography #landscape #cbd #urbanliving #shotoniphone7plus
