Seven years ago on 30 June 2011, the final #ktm #keretapitanahmelayu #train to ever leave #tanjongpagar #tanjongpagarrailwaystation departed on its final journey back to #malaysia The trains would never run on these tracks again after that night. In the months leading up to that last night, I made a series of photos of the #senandungexpress as it departed Singapore at 2200hrs for #kualalumpur and every night when I was shooting I would camp at a spot where the train would pass. This is the SS24 going under a small #bridge at Old Holland Road. The bridge still exists today.
