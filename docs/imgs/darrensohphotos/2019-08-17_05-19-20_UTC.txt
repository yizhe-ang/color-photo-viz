The full moon rises over the Choa Chu Kang Chinese Cemetery on Thursday night during the 15th day of the Lunar 7th month - more commonly known as the day of the Hungry Ghosts Festival.

As I've mentioned in my last two posts, grave exhumation has already begun (and in some cases completed) in many of the older plots of the cemetery, and in this image, you can actually see a grave that has already been exhumed on the right - with the photograph and parts of the grave stone removed as well.

Over 80,000 graves will be exhumed and 100 ha of land handed back to the government for the expansion of Tengah Airbase.
