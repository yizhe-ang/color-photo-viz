Paul Rudolph was born on October 23 1918 in Elkton, Kentucky and if he were still alive today he would have just turned 100. These three images are all close ups of the facade of The Concourse in Singapore, completed in 1994 and the second last of Rudolphâ€™s projects in the region before his death in 1997. All three images were #shotoniphonexsmax using the #hydraapp which allowed me to make #telephoto views of the building on my #iphone .
