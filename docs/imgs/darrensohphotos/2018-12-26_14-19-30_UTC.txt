Built at the end of 1972 by the @jtc_sg these four joined 21-storey blocks at Yung Kuang Road in @tamanjurong were the pride of housing development in Jurong in the 1970s. When built, they were the tallest buildings in the whole Jurong and they were often spoken in the same breath as the Jurong Town Hall which is today a National Monument. Blocks 63-66 have had somewhat of a chequered past, the hotbed of gangland activities in the 1980s and now used as Low cost rental apartments. I for one am of the opinion that a building should not be judged by its current use and would rather celebrate the fact that they are still standing today. .
