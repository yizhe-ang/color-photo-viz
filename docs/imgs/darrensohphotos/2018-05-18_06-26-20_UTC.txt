Iâ€™m clearing out old books and magazines and came across this old copy of @thesingaporearchitect from 2009 when I was still a young #architecturalphotographer I remember it was an issue on #housing as well back then and #publichousing in particular. It was also my first ever cover image for Singapore Architect and they used my image from #ghimmoh on the cover. Back then, @kelleycheng was the Editorial and Creative Director of the magazine.
