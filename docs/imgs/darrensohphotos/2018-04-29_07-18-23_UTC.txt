I just want to say a BIG THANK YOU to everyone who popped by #appleorchard #appleorchardroad yesterday for my talk on #vernacular and #publichousing #hdb architecture as well as working with the #iphone I suppose this is as good a time to introduce a hashtag I will be using a lot from now on, to describe my work if you may, to photograph #beforeitallgoes THANK YOU! Also thank you @johnstonlcs for this image!
