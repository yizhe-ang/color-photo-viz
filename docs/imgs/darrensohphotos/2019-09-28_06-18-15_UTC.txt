Collectively known as Ghim Moh Valley, these five blocks of super tall HDB Public Housing blocks at Ghim Moh Link were completed in 2013 and the first new HDB development in Ghim Moh in nearly 30 years. They served both as new BTO flats for the public as well as replacement flats for residents from six blocks of older HDB flats at Ghim Moh Road locates right next to the green corridor that were demolished about a year after these were built.

I had previously used the iPhone to photograph this but before the the #iphone11ProMax and other iPhone 11 phones, I could not properly get the estate into one image even with the panorama mode of the cameras. With the 13mm camera of the new iPhone, I have plenty of spare room left over in the frame and this is cropped from a single image #shotoniPhone11ProMax
