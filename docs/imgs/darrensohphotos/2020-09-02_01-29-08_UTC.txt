Completed in 2010, River Vista @ Kallang is the only HDB Public Housing estate in Singapore that is sited at the confluence of two sizeable rivers - the Sungei Whampoa and the Sungei Kallang.

It was also the first HDB estate to integrate the PUBâ€™s Active, Beautiful and Clean Waters Programme into its design.
