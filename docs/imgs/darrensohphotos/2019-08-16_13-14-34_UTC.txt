Last night was the 15th Day of the Lunar 7th Month or officially the Hungry Ghost Festival and every year I will visit the Choa Chu Kang Chinese Cemetery to photograph the people who go there to pay respects - not necessarily to their own ancestors.

These are children’s graves, and there was a family there lighting candles, offering orange juice and toys to every single one of these graves.

I was there with two other photographer friends of mine and we observed that many many of the older graves have either already been exhumed or are in the midst of getting exhumed as the deadline for the cemetery’s return to the State looms.

Over 80,000 graves will be exhumed and 100 ha of land handed back to the government for the expansion of Tengah Airbase.
