The Bukit Timah Waterworks were called the Bukit Timah Filters and Clear Water Tank when they were first built in 1891 by James MacRitchie, who was Municipal Engineer of Singapore from 1883 to his untimely death in 1895. During his tenure as Municipal Engineer, MacRitchie not only expanded Singapore’s waterworks but also completed the Telok Ayer Market (known today as Lau Pa Sat) and pioneered the use of iron for bridge building in all of Malaya. When he died, the newspapers called MacRitchie the “most important man in the community”. In the @nationalgallerysingapore (the former City Hall) hangs a bronze plaque commemorating James MacRitchie’s life and work. It was commissioned in 1896 a year after his death and features four projects he was directly responsible for - the Bukit Timah Water Works (top left), MacRitchie Reservoir which he expanded by wasn’t named after him till 1922 (too right) and Kim Seng (bottom right) and Read (bottom left) bridges.
