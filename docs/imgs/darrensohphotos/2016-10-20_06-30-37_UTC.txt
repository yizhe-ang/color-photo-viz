This #oldschool (literally) building on #dunearnroad in #singapore used to hold the #chineseinternationalschool that has moved and rebranded itself. It was certainly another school before that life but I've not been able to locate the name of the school. (Edit: this used to be Swiss Cottage Secondary School, thank you Dawn!) I am however quite sure this structure is the school assembly hall as many school buildings from the 70s and 80s were constructed in this manner. #archivingsg #architectureporn #architecturelovers #architecture #vernacular #architecturephotography #sgarchitecture #architecturesg #shotoniphone7plus #shotoniphone7
