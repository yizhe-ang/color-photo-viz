I had the chance to take the newly announced @sonyalpha α7IV for a 36 hour spin last week ahead of its launch in December and I have to say I’m pretty impressed with what is supposed to be an “entry level” α Fullframe camera. Spotting a brand new 33MP sensor, you can now crop into the image after if you so wish with minimal loss in image quality. It also has a very competent AF system complete with the usual Face, Eye and Animal detect options. The new menu system is also much welcomed but the best new feature for me has to be the articulated rear LCD screen which allowed me to make this image at People’s Park Complex in Singapore with the SEL1224GM 12-24mm G Master lens holding my camera just millimetres above the puddle. Because I could position the screen parallel to the water surface, I could accurately frame the shot instead of shooting blind.
