This classic view down Temple Street of Peopleâ€™s Park Complex is best made early in the morning when the sun hits the side facade of PPC. 

There is also less traffic on Temple Street and you can stand in the middle of the street to frame it up without getting honked at.

The uncle crossing the street is an added bonus to provide a sense of scale to the scene. ðŸ‘Œ
