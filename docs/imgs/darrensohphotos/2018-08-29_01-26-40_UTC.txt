It is the Lunar 7th month now and in previous years I have managed to photograph getai performances religiously but sadly am unable to do so this year. This image of a getai at People’s Park was made some five years ago and I’ve not been able to photograph one there since. If anyone knows of any major 7th month activity happening in Chinatown this year please drop me a message, I’d really like to make photos of them #beforeitallgoes .
