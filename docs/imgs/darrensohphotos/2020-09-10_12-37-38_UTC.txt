One thing I really love about Little India is its rich culture and history that also live within unassuming hotel buildings.
 
Many of the smaller hotels in Little India such as The Daulat and Perak Hotel started off as shophouses, and what’s not known to many is that Hotel 81 Rochor was first built just before the Second World War. The Great Madras also takes up a building that has been proudly perched on Madras Street since the 1940s.
 
Take a look at all the spots I have rediscovered over at @STB_SG, and share your own hidden gem in Little India with #SingapoRediscovers.
