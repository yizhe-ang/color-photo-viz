This view of 271 Queens Street was made from #rochorcentre which is in the process of emptying its residents out because the flats are going to be demolished by next year. Once the flats go, so will this view. Incidentally this block isn't pink in colour - the colour comes from the OG logo next to it. üòÅ #publichousing #hdb #rochor #building #architecture #sgarchitecture #archdaily #archilovers #architecturephotography #nocturnal #nightphotography #sonyalphaprofessionals #sonya7rii #cities #urban #cityliving
