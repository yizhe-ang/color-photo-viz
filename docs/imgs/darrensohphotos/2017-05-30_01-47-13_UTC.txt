@gardensbythebay turns #FIVE in a month and I'm happy to have documented its journey from before it was a garden to what it is today. Here is an image of the #flowerdome at the gardens when it first topped out. The amazing structure of the dome by @wilkinsoneyre and #grantassociates can be seen clearly in this photo made at a time when no vegetation inhabited it. #sgscape #sgcityscape #sgarchitecture #sglandscape #archdaily #archivingsg #architecture #architecturesg #architecturelovers #architecturephotography #landscapephotography #landscapesg #dome
