The new @Apple @marinabaysands store opens tomorrow 10 September.

As usual, Apple and Foster + Partners’ attention to detail doesn’t disappoint. The thin black frame in this image denotes where the slim glass panels will seat when the store is not open, basically demarcating the entrance to the store. The glass panels are automated and move in and out of position on rails hidden beneath the floor.

I had an exclusive opportunity to photograph the store for @designandarchitecturemag and the piece is now live! Link to the story is in my bio.
