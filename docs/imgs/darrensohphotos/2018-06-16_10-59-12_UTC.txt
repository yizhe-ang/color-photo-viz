A night version of the #hdb #publichousing #flats at #tanglinhalt that will be demolished after 2020 as part of the HDBâ€™s Selective Redevelopment Enbloc Scheme (SERS) where residents of entire public housing estates are uprooted to new sites and the old destroyed to make way for new developments. This version of the image will be in my upcoming exhibition and book launching on 21 August 2018 at @objectifscentre .
