#hdb #publichousing #apartments at #farrerpark have one facing that has completely no view because it faces the #istana in #singapore where the #primeminister has his office and the #president of Singapore his official residence. If you look around the area, you will notice the buildings all have no direct line of sight to the Istana grounds for #security reasons. #sgarchitecture #architecturesg #architecture #archdaily #architecturephotography #archilovers #sg #vernacular #sonya7rii #sonyalphaprofessionals
