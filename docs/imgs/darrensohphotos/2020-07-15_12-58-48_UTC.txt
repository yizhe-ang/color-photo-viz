The first five years of the (Housing and Development Board) HDB’s existence from 1960-1964 was crucial as a “report card” on whether the agency would work well as compared to the ill-fated (Singapore Improvement Trust) SIT and as we all know by now, they passed with flying colours. Blocks like this - 9 Selegie House, Singapore’s tallest public housing block when completed in 1963 at 20 storeys remains impressive even today. During National Day season (months of July and August) the residents’ committee (not individual home owners) would drop the corridors of all three blocks at Selegie House with the National Flag. Selegie House also had the honour of being declared open in 1963 by founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew.
