Sometimes an unintended “mistake” can lead to interesting outcomes, especially in photography. This #facade shot of a block of old #hdb #publichousing flat in #ghimmoh was made some 12 years ago when I was still using a #largeformat camera. As some of you know, when you focus thru the lens using the ground glass on the 4x5 camera, you open the aperture up to its maximum opening for ease of focusing then stop it down before you make the exposure. It was one of those times where I calculated the exposure based on f22 but exposed at f5.6 instead because I forgot to stop down. I must say the result wasn’t half bad. Just 4 stops overexposed. .
