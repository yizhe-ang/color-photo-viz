#lengkokbahru in #singapore is an area dating back to early independence and many of the #hdb #publichousing #flats there were first built in the mid 1960s. These two blocks, 63A and 63B were however only completed in 2001, and were built to accommodate home owners who used to live on flats along #Redhillroad that have been demolished. In their place today stands a number of super tall new condominiums.
