Another view of the State Courts Tower sitting behind Furama City Centre as seen down Eu Tong Sen Street with all the other modern icons like People’s Park Complex and the conserved former Subordinate Courts Building visible in this frame.

Once again, I’d like to reiterate that it is more than possible for architecture spanning different eras to coexist in the same space and have relationships and dialogue with one another.

The new State Courts Tower is designed by @chrislee.serie and his team at Serie Architects with Multiply Architects. Executive Architects are CPG Consultants.
