The 99% #supermoon as seen on November 15th 2016 in #singapore the night the moon was closest to the earth, cloud cover was so heavy it completely obscured the moon. Tonight, the skies are somewhat clearer and I managed this shot. You can just make out the control tower at @changiairport on the far left. #landscapesg #sglandscape #landscapephotography #nightphotography #nocturnal #moon #moonlight #moonrise #changi #sonya7rii #sonyalphaprofessionals
