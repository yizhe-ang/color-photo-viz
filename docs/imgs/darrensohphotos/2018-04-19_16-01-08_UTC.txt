Completed in 1973, the #nationalstadium of #singapore was the pride and joy of the nation where above all else, it was the home to the #nationaldayparade. In the mid 2000s, a new #singaporesportshub @sgsportshub was proposed and I photographed the last ever #NDP at the stadium on 9th August 2006. I used a 4x5 #largeformat #camera and sat in the spectator stand with the camera fixed in the same position for the entire duration of the parade and made 10 images. This is my tribute to the now demolished National Stadium. .
