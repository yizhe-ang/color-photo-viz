This next flares image is quite special. It was made on New Year’s Day 2011 all the way from Toa Payoh Central in the middle of the island.

It would be one of the last times that one could see the Singapore Flyer in its entirety from this particular vantage point because a building has come up that gets in the way.

You can also see the aftermath of the Marina Bay fireworks (ie smoke) in the right most edge of this photo. 

I will be sharing here three images I’ve made in the last decade of this practice of firing flares from ships at the stroke of midnight on New Year’s Day. Remember not to take anything for granted and photograph everything; you never know when it would be the last time you can do so.
