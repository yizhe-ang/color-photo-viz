@aikbengchia and I had the amazing opportunity of hosting Apple CEO Tim Cook at Tiong Bahru Market this morning for breakfast and a quick tour. I also managed to give Tim a quick rundown about the architectural history of the buildings in Tiong Bahru and of course we made photos together. For someone who has been a Mac user for the last twenty years and an iPhone user since the 3GS, this was a real honour and privilege for me! #shotoniphone by @aikbengchia #Apple #timcook #tiongbahru #singapore
