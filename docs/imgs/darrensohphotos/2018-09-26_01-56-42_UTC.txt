This is #peoplesparkcomplex #珍珠坊 in #Chinatown #singapore designed by the #designpartnership and completed between 1970 - 1973. It was a project that arose from the #HDB ‘s first government land sales programme and has become an icon of Chinatown. In February this year, the owners started a process looking toward selling the entire building in a collective sale. I am unsure if they have managed to get the mandatory 80% vote in order to move forward but if it does go, it would be a sad day for #architecture and #history for our nation. This image was #shotoniphonexsmax using the #hydraapp which allowed me to turn the #iPhone ‘s camera into a 112mm equivalent telephoto lens. .
