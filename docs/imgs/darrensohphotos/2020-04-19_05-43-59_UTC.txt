It’s been over two weeks (and counting) since I headed out with my cameras but I am determined to do my part and #stayhome except for grocery and food runs. These next three posts consist of images of a housing complex from my archives that have yet proven to have a life beyond their original intended purpose.

Built at the end of 1972 by the @jtc_sg these four joined 21-storey blocks at Yung Kuang Road in @tamanjurong were the pride of housing development in Jurong in the 1970s. When built, they were the tallest buildings in the whole Jurong and they were often spoken in the same breath as the Jurong Town Hall which is today a National Monument.

It was announced by Senior Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam who is MP for Taman Jurong that the four blocks will now be used temporarily to accommodate members of our migrant worker community who continue to work in essential services during these hard times.

At the risk of sounding overly dramatic, I will say that no other housing complex in Singapore has been called to come to humanity’s aid as often as the Diamond Blocks have, from their original purpose they were initially built for in order to further Singapore’s expansion of our industrial west in the early 1970s to their repurposing as interim rental housing and finally their latest use as emergency housing for our migrant workers.
