Because of all the tall buildings surrounding #laupasat here in #singapore it is more often than not in shadow. Between 12-1pm is probably the best time to get a shot where the roof and #clocktower are in light. Lau Pa Sat or literally old market is the oldest surviving "market" in Singapore and is home to a myriad of hawker food stalls. #sglandscape #landscapephotography #landscapesg #landscape #archdaily #archivingsg #architecture #architecturesg #architecturelovers #architecturephotography #sgarchitecture #shotoniphone7plus #shotoniphone #madewithoowa #oowalife @oowalife
