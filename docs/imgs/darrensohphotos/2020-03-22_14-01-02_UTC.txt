What started as a desire to set some work affairs in order (clearing my desk and addressing backlogs etc) before I came back to Instagram has led to a nearly 3 month hiatus. In that 3 months, I’m clearly not exaggerating by saying that the world has changed.

The latest here in Singapore of course is that we have effectively shut down our borders to all short term visitors - which means zero tourists and zero tourism dollars. This is necessary of course in order to stem the influx of even more imported cases of #covid19 #coronavirus but my heart goes out to all those whose businesses are nearly entirely dependent on tourism - like all the shops and restaurants at @jewelchangiairport

Like many others, you may feel torn between holing up at home and going out to support our bruised and battered SMEs and I’m not advocating huge parties here, but the restaurants at Jewel and many other locations do need your patronage now more than ever. Go at non peak hours, maintain physical distancing, take all the precautions you need, but so long as you aren’t on quarantine, SHN or LOA, every bit of spending helps now. .
