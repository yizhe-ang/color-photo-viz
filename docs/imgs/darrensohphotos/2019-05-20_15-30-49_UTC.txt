Selegie House has a new paint scheme (actually it has had it for the last few months) so this year, the National Day flags will be draped against a backdrop of light brown instead of grey as it has been for as long as I can remember.

The three blocks of Selegie House - 8, 9 and 10 Selegie Road were completed in 1963 and was the HDBâ€™s FIRST major housing project in the central area of Singapore apart from its build up of Queenstown, Bukit Ho Swee, Redhill, MacPherson and Tanjong Rhu in the early 1960s.
