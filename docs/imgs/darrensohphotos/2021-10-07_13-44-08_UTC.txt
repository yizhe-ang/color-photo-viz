One of the “secret weapon” features of the new iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max that hasn’t gotten very much air time at all is the fact that the telephoto camera, which is now a 3x 77mm equivalent, can shoot in Night Mode.

That’s right, ladies and gentlemen, you can now get the compressed telephoto look with your iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max.

The last image from this series brings us back to where the HDB first started - Queenstown. I made this photo from the top floor of one of the newest blocks just recently completed at Margaret Drive and shot towards Stirling Road and Mei Ling Street. You can see the first point blocks ever built by the HDB in the form of blocks 160 and 161 Mei Ling Street as well as later redevelopment projects from the 1990s.
