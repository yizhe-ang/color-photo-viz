Because the #flats in #tiongbahru are so much in the public consciousness, they really need to be photographed in the best of light to do them real justice or to add anything new to the thousands of images that already exist of them. I have fortunately had a few opportunities to do so and here are three images of them, a mix of the conserved pre-war flats and one image of the yet-to-be conserved post-war ones.
