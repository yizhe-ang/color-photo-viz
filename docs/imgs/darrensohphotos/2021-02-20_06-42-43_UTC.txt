In 1991, then Minister for National Development S. Dhanabalan announced a new scheme where the HDB would start inviting private architects to design HDB public housing.

Known as the Design and Build Scheme, its aim was to encourage more vibrancy in the design of public housing in Singapore. The first Design and Build HDB neighbourhoods were completed in the mid 1990s in Tampines but by the end of the 1990s, there were many other Design and Build precincts coming online in towns like Choa Chu Kang, Jurong West and Woodlands.

This is Woodlands N6C5, a cluster of some 16 residential blocks and 2 multi storey carparks located at Woodlands Drive 63 and 72 (blocks 681A - 684D). Completed in January 1999, the neighbourhood was built by a team of well known consultants. Itâ€™s architect was @ongong_360 with engineering by @meinhardtsg and landscape design by @tierradesign_sg

Some of you would know Ong&Ong as the architecture firm that was founded by the late President Ong Teng Cheong and his wife Ling Siew May in 1972 before he entered politics.
