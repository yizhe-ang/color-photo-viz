Congratulations to @design.meta  and Lua Architects for #khongguanbuilding winning the design award at this year’s SIA Awards organised by the @siarchitects to recognise #Singapore registered architects.

To quote the SIA- “The jury conceded that the project ‘sits’ on a wedge-shaped site which was difficult to approach in terms of design.

The new twisted forms with its triangulated language, the use of materials, the opening up of the massing with receding courtyards is clever in bringing light into the interior and addressing the 2 roads it fronts, resulting in the careful addition of the ‘new’ that blends in seamlessly with the ‘old’ in a subtle manner and where ‘new’ and the ‘old’ is almost unrecognizable.

From a conservation point of view, it went beyond mere conservation into an adaptive conservation that is clever, careful and elegant.”
