Iâ€™m really happy to share about this new project I have been working on with @temasektrustsg and @temasekshophouse as they expand beyond 28 Orchard Road to the other three gazetted shophouses along Orchard Road adjacent to the original Temasek Shophouse. The three additional shophouses have amazingly rich histories - one of them (20 Orchard Road) used to house Malayan Motors and was a car showroom for Ford and Morris Cars. It later became home for the @singaporeinstituteofarchitects I had an amazing time documenting all the shophouses for Temasek Foundation.
