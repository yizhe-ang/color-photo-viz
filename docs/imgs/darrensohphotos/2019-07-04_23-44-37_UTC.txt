I’ve taken a two week hiatus from Instagram as I was away on a family holiday in a land far far away but I’m back now with more tales of public housing in Singapore.

First up, we have these two point blocks in #jalanrajah #Balestier #whampoa which are 25 storeys in height and some of the first point blocks built in this “new” typology when they were completed in 1983. 25 storeys in height, these two blocks are interesting for two reasons. Firstly, they were the very first HDB blocks to be built with any form of mechanisation using pre fab technology which was less labour intensive and part of the HDB’s move to building quicker. Secondly, they were also the first blocks built by a government owned construction company - Construction Technology Private Limited, which made the headlines back in April 1981 when they won the contract. I wonder what has become of the company today and will need to do more research on it.
