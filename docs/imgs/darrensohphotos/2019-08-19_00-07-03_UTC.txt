This is Marsiling Heights, one of the newer Housing & Development Board #HDB estates in the original part of #Woodlands that is today more commonly known as #Marsiling

Marsiling Heights consists of three 31-storey blocks, of which two (Blocks 180A and 180B) have studio, 2-Room and 3-Room flats that were sold to the public. The remaining block of 180C consists entirely of rental 1-Room and 2-Room flats.

Marsiling Heights was completed in end 2014 with key collection commencing in 2015 and a lease starting from July 2015 (for the two blocks that had flats sold to the public). The estate is interesting for a few reasons.

Marsiling Heights was the first HDB estate that combined both rental and for-sale units by design - a practice that has now become the norm so that rental flats can be better integrated into estates - and as I mentioned before in a previous post - I believe this is done to combat the formation of rental ghettos.

The other reason why Marsiling Heights is so interesting is its facade design, an otherwise monotonous face of windows and parapets broken by a very clever helix pattern formed by painting the parapets in a different shade of grey from the facade, something which amazingly cannot be seen from street level. You'd have to get up to height like I did for this image in order to see the pattern. In fact, even if you are staring at the blocks with your naked eye from up close, the pattern can elude you and using a wideangle lens brings it out in the photograph.

Marsiling Heights is designed by @dparchitects for the HDB.
