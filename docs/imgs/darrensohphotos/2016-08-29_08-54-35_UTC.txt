We live in a world of relatives and grey areas and while there is always room for improvement when it comes to housing for the tens of thousands of foreign workers who build our homes, I've certainly seen public housing projects in our neighboring countries which are far worse off than some of the new dorms built for the workers here. As I type this, I keep getting prompted to join the "Tuas Dormitories" wifi network. #foreignworkers #migrantworkers #tuas #workersquarters #dormitory #singapore #architecture #architecturephotography #architecture #archdaily #sgarchitecture #architecturesg #shotoniphone6s
