When it was completed in 1963, Selegie House boasted several “firsts”. Block 9, which stood at 20 storeys in height, was the tallest public housing building in the whole of Singapore when completed. Because it had shops on the ground level, this also made Selegie House the tallest mixed-use development then. It was also the first development built by the HDB in the central area with most of the HDB’s work concentrated in Bukit Ho Swee, Queenstown, Tanjong Rhu and MacPherson.
