Congratulations to @chihwenchaw for winning at this yearâ€™s @siarchitects Architecture Awards with his design of the Sensible House, a multi-generational terrace house in the eastern part of Singapore with a twist. The design resembles a house sitting within the two party walls of the terrace adjoining its neighbours on the left and right more than a terrace house. Happy to have photographed the Sensible House. Congrats!
