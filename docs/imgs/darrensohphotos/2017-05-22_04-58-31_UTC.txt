@scmp_lifestyle ran a story three days ago about the rise, life and demise of the #holga #camera a completely #hongkong creation that took the world by storm in the early 2000s when we were seeking spontaneity with our #film cameras. Looking back, the holga was really the #precursor and #blueprint upon which #hipstamatic and #instagram #filters were built. I still have my Holga and perhaps I should put some film through it again.
