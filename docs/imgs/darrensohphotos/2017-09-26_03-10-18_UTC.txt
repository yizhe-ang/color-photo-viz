I finally made it to @dparchitects ' #50thanniversary #exhibition  at the @urasingapore gallery. Much of #singapore was designed by #dparchitects including the iconic #peoplesparkcomplex and #goldenmilecomplex Here are three images of the largest #model on display - that of Golden Mile Complex of course - complete with #hipsters hanging out at the level 9 open deck - a reflection of reality perhaps. ðŸ˜œ #metabolism #metabolist #metabolistarchitecture #taykhengsoon #williamlim #ganengoon #sgarchitecture #archdaily #archivingsg #architecturesg #architecture #architecturelovers #architecturephotography #modernist #modernism #sonya7rii #sonyalphaprofessionals
