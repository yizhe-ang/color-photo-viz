The Housing and Development Board of Singapore wasn’t always the only builder of public housing here in Singapore. 

In the 1970s, when public housing building was at its peak, the @jtc_sg also built a very significant number of public housing estates in areas like Boon Lay, Sembawang, Taman Jurong, Teban Gardens and here in Pandan Gardens. 

Many of these blocks of flats built by the JTC have now been demolished due to redevelopment and some estates (like Sembawang) have completely disappeared. 

In Pandan Gardens however, you will find the last completely intact JTC built housing estate, with sixteen blocks of flats built entirely by the JTC from 1978 - 1979 all still standing today. Ranging from 4-storey “shophouse” blocks to 3-Room and 4-Room slab blocks as well as 5-Room point blocks, you will also find four 5-Room only slab blocks that cannot be found anywhere else in Singapore.

This is block 403, one of the 5-Room flats only slab blocks.
