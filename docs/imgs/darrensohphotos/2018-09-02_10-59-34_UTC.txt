Yesterday we had a very special guest attend my talk for #beforeitallgoes at @objectifscentre He was Mr. Chan Seng Kee, principal architect of #degarchitects and the man responsible for giving #rochorcentre its primary colour hues. I guess we have Mr Chan to thank for Rochor becoming a hipster’s haunt and instagrammers’ praradise. .
