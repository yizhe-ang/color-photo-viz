What to do when you are faced with one of the most fabulous curves that #publichousing #architecture has to offer in #singapore ? You go to town with the #iphone #panorama mode of course! This is Block 161 Hougang St. 11, a serpentine shaped #HDB public housing estate designed by my Friend @athanasiostsakonas This image was shot on the #iphonexsmax panning horizontally from top to bottom of the block while standing on level 10. ðŸ˜ƒ .
