The new iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro comes with a completely refreshed design that harks back to the iPhone 4 and 5’s flat edges but upsized and with super slim bezels. They also have 5G and now all use OLED panels but for me the biggest improvements lie in the camera system and this image of Toa Payoh Central I made with the iPhone 12’s wide camera in Night Mode is a testimony to that improved imaging system.
