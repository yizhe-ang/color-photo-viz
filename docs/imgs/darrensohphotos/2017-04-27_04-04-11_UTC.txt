This is another view of #block 82 #commonwealthclose my childhood home. I've photographed it many ways but never at #night so this is the first time I've done it. It's part of three 16 storey blocks on top of the hill and we're built in #1967 just two years after #singapore gained independence. #hdb #publichousing #singaporearchitecture #sgarchitecture #architecturephotography #architecturelovers #archdaily #archivingsg #architecturesg #nightphotography #nocturnal #urbanliving #SonyRX #SonyRXMoments #SonySG_RX #RXthroughmyeyes #SonyRX100m4 @sonysingapore 006/006
