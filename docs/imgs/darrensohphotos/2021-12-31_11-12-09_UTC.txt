Completed in 1980, Townhouse Apartments lives up to its name in a literal way where three storey homes are stacked on top of each other to form a block of apartments. The strong geometric lines are again an evidence of Kumpulan Akitekâ€™s work. Because the back of this building faces the Istana, it has no windows on that facing at all.

Like Highpoint and the others that came before such as Cairnhill Mansion and Hilltops, strata held residential only developments will be the most prone to complete redevelopment when the price is right. And there will always be a time when the price becomes right. Without legislative intervention or strong incentives, it is a matter of time before we lose these buildings.
