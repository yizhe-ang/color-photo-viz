Renowned Chinese American architect I.M. Pei has passed away on 15 May 2019.

Pei was 102 years old and lived an amazingly prolific life as an architect. He was known to be extremely sensitive to the sites upon which he built and here in Singapore, I.M. Pei built three (four if you include Suntec City which he worked on with @tsaomckown and @dparchitects) buildings which I will share today. The last building of his that I will share is probably also his purest in form. Completed in 1990, this is The Gateway, a pair of buildings which bear more than a passing resemblance to his other mega project completed about the same time - the Bank of China Tower in Hong Kong. The Gateway is such an amazing building that up till today, people who have never seen it in person still refuse to believe it is actually three dimensional.
