These #hdb #publichousing #flats at #tanglinhalt will be demolished after 2020 as part of the HDBâ€™s Selective Redevelopment Enbloc Scheme (SERS) where residents of entire public housing estates are uprooted to new sites and the old destroyed to make way for new developments. A version of this image will be in my upcoming exhibition and book launching on 21 August 2018 at @objectifscentre .
