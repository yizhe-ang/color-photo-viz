This is the #grahabethanynginden South East Asiaâ€™s largest #megachurch structure located in #surabaya #indonesia I photographed it from the air on Sunday so I could get a sense of scale for that massive #dome using the cars driven to church by the congregation. The church boasts an attendance of about 50,000 every Sunday. .
