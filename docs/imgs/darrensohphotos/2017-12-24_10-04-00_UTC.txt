Six Christmases ago I photographed the #pelicanplayground at #Dover estate in #singapore it was the the last of its kind and shortly after that it was demolished. It appears that the #hdb has stopped demolishing #oldplayground s because they realise the playgrounds are important as a link to our #heritage and past for many people. Those we have lost we aren’t getting back however so this Christmas let’s take some time to cherish the ones we have left.
