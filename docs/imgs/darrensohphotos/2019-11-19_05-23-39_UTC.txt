Iâ€™ve always said that in Singapore, the only constant is change.

Nowhere else is this more apparent than in our built landscape, where old buildings are demolished and new buildings built at a pace faster than most other nations. Even our public housing blocks have to change at least every seven years in the form of a complete repainting and sometimes this results in a new paint scheme less attractive than the former.

In this next three posts I will be sharing what some HDB blocks used to look like before they were repainted to their current colours.

This is block 538 Upper Cross Street, or better known as a part of Hong Lim Complex, which today is adorned in an olive drab brown colour. It used to be blue as you can see.
