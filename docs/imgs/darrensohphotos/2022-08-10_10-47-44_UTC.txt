Yesterday, on 9 August 2022, the Padang became Singapore's 75th National Monument. 

With this gazette, it joins its storied neighbours like the Victoria Memorial Hall (completed more or less to this current form in 1906), the former City Hall (1929) and the former Supreme Court (1939) in the league of the most protected spaces and structures in Singapore.

I made this photo of the Padang at the National Day Parade of 2000 when I was an intern at the Straits Times 22 years ago. The former Supreme Court and former City Hall are both visible in the background.
