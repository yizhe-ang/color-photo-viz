Some sixteen years ago in 2004 I published my first photo book in the form of While You Were Sleeping. WYWS was a series of nocturnal landscapes made on medium format film in Singapore - where I drove to places lately untouched by the bright streetlights of Singapore. These were our cemeteries, reservoirs and some far reaches of our industrial West and North.

I have had the newly launched iPhone 12 Pro Max for the past week and hatched an idea to torture test the iPhone in some of these unlit corners of Singapore. With its larger pixels (and therefore larger sensor area) in its wide-angle camera, I wondered if the iPhone would be able to see anything at all in these super dark sites I intended to photograph in. 

I made this image in Bukit Brown Cemetery with the iPhone 12 pro Max in Night Mode on the wide-angle camera with an exposure of 30 secs. All images were made with the iPhone on a tripod and were only lightly edited for contrast. In many instances, it was so dark I could not see in colour at all and it was only after making the image that I saw the colour in the scene.
