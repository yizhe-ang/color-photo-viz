Officially completed in 1973 but actually built in phases between 1971 and 1974, Golden Mile Complex was originally named Woh Hup Complex after the company that developed and built the complex. @wohhupgroup is one of Singaporeâ€™s oldest home grown builders having been in existence for nearly a century and through Singapura Developments, a former subsidiary set up in aid of nation building, Golden Mile Complex was born. Its architects were Tay Kheng Soon, William Lim and Gan Eng Oon. Last year, the @urasingapore announced that the government would be considering Golden Mile Complex for conservation given its unique architecture and place in history.

Those of you familiar with this straight on view of Golden Mile Complex will know that it requires roughly a 20mm FOV coverage to get a shot where you can see the complex with its adjoining swimming pool. However the iPhone only has a 1x 26mm equivalent wide angle or a 0.5x 13mm equivalent lens so what I did was use the hydra app that allowed me to get a high resolution (roughly 26 megapixels) ultra wide angle shot and then crop in to this composition.
