#jurongfisheryport has been in operation since #1969 but will be redeveloped at the end of the year. As  with most cases of that in #singapore some authentic flavour is bound to be lost. The port is open to the public, so head on down in the wee hours of the early morning from 1am onwards to catch some of the action. #archivingsg #vernacular #architecture #archdaily #architecturephotography #architecturelovers #sonyalphaprofessionals #sonya7rii #jurong #fish #fishingport
