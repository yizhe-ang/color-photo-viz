A #squall of the southern coast of #singapore this morning resulted in this dramatic image #shotoniphone7plus #madewithoowa #sumatra squalls are quite common here and they always blow in from the #northwest having formed in the #straitsofmalacca off Sumatra. The #marinasouthpier is a good place to view them. #storm #stormclouds #stormchasers #stormchaser #stormchasing #sglandscape #landscapephotography #landscapesg #shotoniphone
