Another image from my project in 2003/4 documenting the last days of the National Library building at Stamford Road up till its closure and demolition in 2004. This was the insides of the children's library. Note the clouds on the ceiling. :) #library #nationallibrary #nationalmonument #sgmemory #singapore #architecture #urbanism #cityscape #landscape #urbanliving #singaporelandscape #singaporearchitecture #sgbuilding #sgarchitecture #sglandscape #instasg #igsg #archivingsg
