#Block 19 #jalansultan is a #hdb #publichousing block in the #crawford estate that I've photographed many times before from this perspective because of the strikingly different Colour temperatures of the light fittings used on the #commoncorridor along each floor. The block was very recently repainted red and I returned to make this shot again. #sgarchitecture #archdaily #archivingsg #architecture #architecturesg #architecturelovers #architecturephotography #urbanliving #flats #sonya7rii #sonyalpha #sonyalphaphotos #sonyalphaprofessionals #sonyalphaphotography
