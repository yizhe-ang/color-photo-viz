Thanks to my friend @gaatzaat from Hong Kong who posted an image this morning of a residential estate that looks very much like what the British built here in Singapore, I will spend the next three posts sharing some of these flats built by the colonial government here between 1940 and 1960. Here we have the last remaining slab block of city council housing in Monkâ€™s Hill originally built for civil servants in the late 1940s / early 1950s. A quaint mix of Art Deco with modernism.
