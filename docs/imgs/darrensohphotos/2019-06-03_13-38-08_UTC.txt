As of December 2018, there were nearly 300,000 migrant labourers employed in the construction industry in Singapore.

Of these, a large proportion hail from Bangladesh and are Muslim by faith. Many of them live in giant dormitories far away from any Mosques so I have always wondered how they practised their faith especially during the Holy Month of Ramadan.

Three years ago, on the second last night of Ramadan and the last night for Terawih prayers, I travelled to Tuas in the far west of Singapore on a hunch as I had heard that many of the workers would perform their Terawih prayers on the roadside outside their dormitory.

I found a large group of Bangladeshi workers doing just that and it struck me how faithful they were despite working long hours under the gruelling sun and having to fast at the same time.

Since I made these images in 2016, Iâ€™m really happy to learn that our Muslim brothers from Bangladesh have been given proper prayer spaces within the dormitory and tonight, as I drove around Singapore to areas where there were large concentration of construction worker dormitories I could find no one that needed to pray out on the streets.
