Today Iâ€™m sharing three images of #oldplayground s from my archives, of a handful that are still left standing in #singapore. This particular one used to stand within the grounds of the #KTM #railway staff quarters at #spoonerroad and while the #flats are still standing, the playground has been demolished.
