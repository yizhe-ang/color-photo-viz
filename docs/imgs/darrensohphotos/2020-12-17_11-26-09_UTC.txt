On 31 Dec 2020, the 60 year leases on 191 private terrace houses at a corner of Geylang Lorong 3 will run out. This will be the first time since Singapore gained self rule in 1959 that leases on residential properties will run out and residents have to move out. The majority of the terrace houses at Lorong 3 are not lived in by owner tenants - they are largely rented out to temples and operators of migrant worker dormitories. There is even a church. The land on which they sit will be redeveloped for HDB public housing and a tender for their demolition has already been called by the government to be carried out next year.

I made these three images yesterday evening at Geylang Lorong 3 using the iPhone 12 Pro Max and shooting in the new Apple ProRAW that has come to the iPhone 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max when iOS 14.3 was released this week. Saving my images in Apple ProRAW allows me to make the most of Appleâ€™s computational photography enhancements YET process the image in third party apps like Adobe Lightroom as I would any other raw file since the file format is in DNG. This allows me to control the white balance, sharpness, noise reduction as well as shadows and highlights like never before!
