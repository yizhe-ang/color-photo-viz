This time tomorrow, #pearlbankapartments will be completely emptied out as former residents have till 30th April to vacate. After that it’s lights out, and CapitaLand takes over. Whatever scheme they have coming to replace this iconic 43 year old one of a kind structure, it has giant shoes to fill. It is my hope that it may be a scheme we can all be proud of and will grow into its own over time. Good bye Pearl Bank, it’s been a blast. .
