This is Havelock Square, a historical part of Singapore in Chinatown dating back to the 1800s.

These days the view is dominated by the new State Courts Tower designed by @chrislee.serie and his team together with @multiplyarchitects and @cpgcorporation (003/003) which was completed in 2019 but the former Subordinate Courts building (002/003) designed by Kumpulan Akitek and completed in 1974 is still an important part of the architectural landscape and more importantly a conservation building since July 2013.

On the far left is block 51 Chin Swee Road (001/003), a HDB rental block with 328 1-Room flats completed in 1973. Because of the high demand of HDB rental flats from those who really need government help, the block is probably going to stand for awhile yet.
