A lot has been said about the fabulous new wideangle and the now almost distortion free ultra wide angle cameras in the new iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro but for me, I still really love the telephoto camera that comes with the iPhone 12 Pro as it allows me images like this of the new State Courts Towers shot this evening in Chinatown Singapore in the gorgeous light just before sunset. The State Courts Towers is designed by @chrislee.serie and his team at Serie in collaboration with @multiplyarchitects and @cpgcorporation
