Personally I am really really happy to have Block 51 Kent Road included in EVERYDAY MODERNISM as it truly epitomises the "everyday" in Singapore's public housing zeitgeist; a block you won't necessarily notice as it doesn't stand out like the special projects of Pinnacle or the ones at Dawson, yet special in its own way. 

Remember, TODAY is the last day you can use the discount code MODERN20 to grab your copy from the NUS Press webstore! Link in BIO above ðŸ‘†
