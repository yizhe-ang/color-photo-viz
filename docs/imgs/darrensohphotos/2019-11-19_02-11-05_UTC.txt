Iâ€™ve always said that in Singapore, the only constant is change.

Nowhere else is this more apparent than in our built landscape, where old buildings are demolished and new buildings built at a pace faster than most other nations. Even our public housing blocks have to change at least every seven years in the form of a complete repainting and sometimes this results in a new paint scheme less attractive than the former.

In this next three posts I will be sharing what some HDB blocks used to look like years ago before they were repainted to their current colours starting with Rowell Court off Jalan Besar, an estate built in the early 1980s. It used to be this beautiful scheme of graduated red but today it is a far less appealing light green.

In the bottom left corner you will see a glimpse of Rochor Centre, which of course will never be repainted again since it was demolished early this year.
