Good morning #kualalumpur it's a great day to be out making photos. In all my years coming to KL for work I've never been able to photograph the #petronastowers in good weather. December isn't exactly the best time of the year with the #monsoon but today I'm blessed with this amazing light. #reflection #water #landscapephotography #cityscape #cityscapephotography #kltower #malaysia #malaysianig #malaysiaig #malaysiatrulyasia #malaysiaboleh #iphoneonly #shotoniphone7plus
