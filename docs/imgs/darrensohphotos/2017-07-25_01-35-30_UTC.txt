We live in a #bravenewworld where #images are celebrated for how much post work the creator puts into the photograph AFTER the moment of capturing it. Call me #oldschool but I believe that #patience #anticipation and the ability to click the shutter at the right #moment while being at the right #vantagepoint without resorting to a #posed #photo will always yield a more endearing and lasting image. I made this photo in #bukitpanjang and waited for the people walking around the #voiddeck to align themselves before I #clicked the shutter. #sg #singapore #archivingsg #publichousing #hdb #heartland #sgarchitecture #archdaily #architecture #architecturesg #architecturelovers #architecturephotography #sonyalphaprofessionals #sonyalphaphotos #sonya7rii #sonyalpha
