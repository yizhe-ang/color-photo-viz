I used to work out of a studio based right in the center of what is known as Singapore’s “Little India” which is an odd misnomer for a place choke full of restaurants, places of worship and people from all cultures and races. These days, it remains one of the few truly authentic neighbourhoods left in the city that hasn’t been gentrified and no other Time is better to visit than on a Sunday night when thousands of migrant workers converge on their day off.
