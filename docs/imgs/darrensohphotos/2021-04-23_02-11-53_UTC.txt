Hunting for good light is one of the things we do the most as architecture and cityscape photographers but many times the best light finds you when you least expect it.

This image of the @visit_singapore skyline was made while I was in the midst of shooting a timelapse sequence for @sonysingapore using the newly announced SEL14f18GM 14mm f1.8 G Master ultra wide angle lens. I originally planned to do a transition from day to dusk but just before the sun set, the clouds on the horizon parted for all of three minutes to cast an amazing glow on the city resulting in this image.

I’ve said this before and I’ll say it again. The best images are often gifted to you and not found or caught.
