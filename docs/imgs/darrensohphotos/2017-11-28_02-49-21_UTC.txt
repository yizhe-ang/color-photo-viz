No running-in of a new camera would be complete if I didn’t bring it to photograph at #Commonwealthclose where I lived when I was born till age 5. Built in 1967, the flats are now 50 years old. With the new @sony @sonyalpha #a7riii using #pixelshift technology the image has never had more details as you can see in the crops I’m posting along with the full image.
