Starting from the late 1960s, the HDB built several mixed-use projects in the city center using the podium-tower typology where a residential block (or several residential blocks) sit on top of a commercial podium. This is the commercial podium of one of the most well known of these complexes - and if you had guessed Bras Basah Complex, you would be absolutely right. 

Completed in 1979 with two 25 floor residential slab blocks sitting atop a 5 storey commercial shopping centre, Bras Basah has become THE place to go to for art supplies, books and general hanging out if one were going to the National Library.
