Bishan public housing estate is one of Singapore’s most expensive public housing estates situated in the middle of the island. This is due to several factors including accessibility to the city via train, good schools as well as the amazing Bishan Ang Mo Kio Park that runs the length of Bishan North. We’ve not had such crisp clear weather in the morning for awhile now and so I took the opportunity to try the iPhone 12 Pro Max’s panorama mode with the 2.5c 65mm equivalent camera.
