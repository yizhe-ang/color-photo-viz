Two decades after it was formed in 1960, the HDB was an efficient, well-oiled piece of machinery churning out flats at a pace unheard of in any other South East Asian country in 1980.

Whether it was building massive new estates from scratch like Hougang / Tampines or exploiting plots of existing open space for smaller estates, the HDB was adopting a multi-pronged approach in housing Singaporeans both near and further out from the city central.

Blocks 101 (right) and 102 (left) Jalan Rajah were considered "an estate" in themselves when conceived and announced in 1979. They even had a name - Rajah Court.

Consisting 128 4-room flats in block 101 and 198 4-room flats in block 102, the two blocks were both curved, with 101 curved outwards and 102 curved inwards, forming two arcs around the open air surface car park. The 392 flats (all 4-room) were balloted on 12 September 1980 in the very same carpark.

The 4-room flats were offered for sale between $36,600 and $37,600. Just for reference, the latest sale prices for these flats on the open market were between $421,000 and $458,000 for transactions in 2018 and 2019.
