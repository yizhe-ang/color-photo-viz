In a dense city state like Singapore, it is really hard to find areas untouched by human intervention no matter where you go. I explored this more in the sequel to While You Were Sleeping - titled In The Still Of The Night and published in 2015.

These are the Malaysia-Singapore water pipes in Woodlands right next to the Singapore American School. I photographed them in 2014 and they actually parallel the now defunct railway line in some ways, running from the causeway to the city. The railway used to terminate at Tanjong Pagar Railway Station. The water pipes still run all the way to Pearlâ€™s Hill Reservoir today.

While You Were Sleeping - The Documentary directed by @ieremv premieres tomorrow 31 March on the @objectifscentre YouTube channel at 2100hrs. Do join us!
