A closer up angle of last night’s Very Momentary Exhibition by @verysmallexhibition at Canberra in Sembawang Estate. Really glad to have helped to document this, a meaningful way to spend Christmas Eve indeed. Do check out Very Small Exhibition’s page and follow if you’d like to be informed about when the next intervention might take place. 

Merry Christmas!
