Yesterday evening's setting sun over the western part of #singapore as seen from the top of #skyville at #dawson which offers a great 360Â° view of the #queenstown and #commonwealth area. The first #publichousing estates were all situated in the area but you'll really need to look hard in order to spot them hidden amongst the tall towers of today. #architecture #architecturesg #sgarchitecture #architecturephotography #architectureporn #architecturelovers  #sglandscape #landscapesg #landscapephotography #hdb #shotoniphone7 #shotoniphone7plus
