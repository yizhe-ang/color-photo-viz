Today I’m sharing three images of #oldplayground s from my archives, of a handful that are still left standing in #singapore. This second one is shaped after the #tongkang s that used to ply the #singaporeriver up to the 1990s. It’s still standing and located in #pasirris near #eliasmall along #eliasroad .
