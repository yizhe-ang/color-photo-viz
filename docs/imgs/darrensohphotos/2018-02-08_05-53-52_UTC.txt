My next few posts will be #throwback images from a time when #digitalphotography was still in its infancy, expensive and quality bad. This image was made 15 years ago when I was burning out as a young photographer directionless and living from cheque to cheque. I did the counterintuitive thing, bought myself a #hasselblad503cw and thus began a series of #nocturnal #landscape images that would come to be known as #whileyouweresleeping I call this the #singapore tree and itâ€™s still there today, in the #limchukang #cemetery .
