Today’s three images are focused on the @nparksbuzz ‘s idea of #singapore being a #cityinagarden #cityinagarden_sg and this was actually mandated by Singapore’s late founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew who made it one of his priorities to transform the island into one of the, if not THE greenest city in the world. The idea is today seen in both public and private spheres, and I will be sharing examples of a few. This is the @shangrilasg ‘s Garden Wing, designed by @watgdesigns completed in 1978 and one of many stunning modernist projects in Singapore. .
