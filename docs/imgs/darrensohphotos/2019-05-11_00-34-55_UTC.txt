In the past five years where I have documented #pearlbankapartments I have always tried to photograph it in the best light possible (pun fully intended). Because the inside curved facade of the tower faces the afternoon sun, the best times to shoot it are from 5pm like I did with this shot where I deliberately truncated the top of the tower in order to show how pure the building looks without its roof.
