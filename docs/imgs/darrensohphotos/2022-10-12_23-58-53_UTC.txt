This is what that view I shared two images ago of @esplanadesingapore looks like today! Yesterday was the 20th birthday of Esplanade - Theatres on the Bay and Iâ€™m terribly honoured to have been commissioned by The Esplanade to photograph the lighting on their domes for their 20th anniversary! How @marinabaysg has transformed in the last 20 years!
