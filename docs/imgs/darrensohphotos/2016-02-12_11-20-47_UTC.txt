This is #singapore 's #centralcatchmentnaturereserve where four #reservoirs are situated and some #primaryforest still remains. It forms the #greenheart and #greenlungs of this small island. Recently there have been plans to build a #subway line through a small part of the reserve but doing so might irreversibly alter parts of the reserve and severely disrupt whatever #wildlife is left in it. Some costs are so high that no amount of money can bring back what is at stake. #sglandscape #landscapephotography #landscape #archivingsg #igsg #instagram_sg 002/003
