Another view of  #clementi town which I have seen transformed over the last 20 years since an undergraduate at @nus_singapore These days itâ€™s full of ultra tall #hdb #publichousing #blocks one of which I used as a vantage point for this photo. You can also see #pinegrove and #pandanvalley in this image as well as the #skyline and #cbd in the far background.
