This next HDB mixed-use project was originally weirdly ALSO named Bras Basah Complex as it was developed in tandem with what we know today as Bras Basah Complex. In fact, the three blocks were completed a year earlier in 1978 and are collectively known today as Waterloo Centre. It is located literally one street away from Bras Basah Complex between Queen Street and Waterloo Street.
