I'm not usually a big fan of the tilt function on my #tiltshift lenses because I find that often times the #miniaturization effect can be gimmicky. But I've started a project to literally blur out the #singapore #skyline to show just how #iconic some of the #buildings in our #cbd are and that when even completely #outoffocus you can still identify them. üòÅ #sgarchitecture #singaporearchitecture #archdaily #archivingsg #architecture #architecturesg #architecturelovers #architecturephotography #architectureporn #sonya7rii #sonyalpha #sonyalphaprofessionals #sglandscape #fullframefullon #nocturnal #cityscape #nightphotography
