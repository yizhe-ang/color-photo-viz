It was Earth Day yesterday, and still is in some locations and I’ll take to take this opportunity to share some images made in 2019 from the Southern Alps of New Zealand to remind us how awesome this planet is.

For those of us stuck in small city states like Singapore, it can be stifling not to be able to travel and see what the rest of the planet has to offer during these pandemic times. Many of us thus live vicariously now through other people’s views or our own past images, hoping and praying that the situation will get better sooner than later.

All three images were made on the iPhone XS Max.
