Here's another #topdown image made 3 years ago during the #lunar7thmonth #hungryghostfestival of a #getai at #peoplesparkcomplex in #chinatown #singapore I believe this was the first time I used a tilt shift lens to photograph in this manner. The front row of empty chairs are reserved for the departed. #vernacular #cityscape #cityliving #urbanism #landscape #landscapesg #sglandscape #nightphotography #nocturnal #throwback
