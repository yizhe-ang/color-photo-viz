I received my #iphone11promax yesterday and despite the haze, have been trying to get some images made with the cameras so as to get a better feel of what this new triple lens camera system is capable of. My first stop was block 82 Commonwealth Close of course and by now I can track images Iâ€™ve made of my old apartment block shot from the iPhone 6 all the way to this newest iPhone 11 Pro Max. This image was made on the wide (26mm) camera.
