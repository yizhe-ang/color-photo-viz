Completed in 2011, #Clementihub was the first #HDB project to integrate public housing residential dwellings right on top of a commercial mall that also included a bus interchange on its ground level.

This model is more common today, one which works in land scarce #singapore in order to maximise land use and incorporate public amenities such as bus and rail stations into a new development.

An unforeseen outcome of this integration is the rocketing of resale prices of the public housing flats in the property after the mandatory five year occupation period lapses. In 2016, one of the units here sold for over a million dollars on the resale market.

Clementi Hub is designed by #surbanajurong
