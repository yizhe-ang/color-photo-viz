And here we have it, the favourite ship flares photo I have ever made, photographed on 1st January 2015 from Marine Parade showing the full glory of the phenomenon in the Eastern Anchorage.

A precious precious photo I will now treasure for all time since I know it is highly unlikely we will be able to shoot this ever again.

I will be sharing here three images Iâ€™ve made in the last decade of this practice. Remember not to take anything for granted and photograph everything; you never know when it would be the last time you can do so.
