I had to photograph the #singapore #skyline yesterday evening for work on my larger cameras so I brought my iPhone X with me of course to see how it would manage a scene like this at dusk and using the @lightroom HDR Capture it managed admirably, even retaining the highlights in the buildingsâ€™ brightly lit signboards. #sgarchitecture #singaporearchitecture #archdaily #archivingsg #architecture #architecturesg #architecturelovers #architecturephotography #architectureporn #sglandscape #sgcityscape #cityscape #iphoneonly #shotoniphonex
