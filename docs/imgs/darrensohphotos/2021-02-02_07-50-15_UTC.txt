Next to Bedok Stadium on Bedok North Road is a precinct of 5 20-storey tall HDB blocks with a very distinct modernist look despite them being completed only in January 2005.

Designed by a Surbana team led by Gidgetelena Ong, the project is called Vista 8 or Bedok N1C19 (Neighbourhood 1 Contract 19).

The running theme of the site is the octagonal shape (hence Vista 8 perhaps) and almost every window of every unit is adorned with a precast sunshade octagonal in shape. In fact, the blocks themselves are also somewhat octagonal when seen from plan view.

The project is unique because it was conceived while Surbana was still the HDBâ€™s Building and Development Division. By the time the project was completed, the architectural team had transited from being in-house architects to a private sector consultant as Surbana Corp. It was only 10 years later in 2015 that Surbana would merge with Jurong International Holdings (JIH) to form @surbanajurong
