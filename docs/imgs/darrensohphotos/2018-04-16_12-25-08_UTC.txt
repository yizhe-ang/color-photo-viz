This is what SEVENTY #hdb #publichousing #facades from #singapore looks like. Over the last twelve years I have photographed hundreds of them and Iâ€™m nowhere near done. I will be sharing some of my work on photographing public housing next Saturday 28th April 4pm at Apple Orchard Road. Details in my profile! .
