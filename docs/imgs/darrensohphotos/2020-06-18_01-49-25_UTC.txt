Arches and skinny columns.

In my previous post I shared about the Housing and Urban Development Corporation that the HDB set up in 1974 to build, market and sell housing meant for Singapore’s middle income citizens.

Here is another view of Hougang N7 located along Hougang Ave 2 and later renamed Florence Regency after privatisation in 2014.

Because of this unique law that allowed HUDC estates to be privatised, many of them have since been sold en bloc on the collective sale market, demolished and redeveloped. Ironically it is two of the earliest HUDC estates that remain standing today - Lakeview estate as well as Braddell View. Famous former HUDC sites include Gillman Heights (today’s Interlace) and Farrer Court (today’s D’Leedon). Florence Regency was demolished in 2019 and is currently being redeveloped.
