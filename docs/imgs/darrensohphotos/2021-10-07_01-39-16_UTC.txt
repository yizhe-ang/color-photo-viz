One of the “secret weapon” features of the new iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max that hasn’t gotten very much air time at all is the fact that the telephoto camera, which is now a 3x 77mm equivalent, can shoot in Night Mode.

That’s right, ladies and gentlemen, you can now get the compressed telephoto look out of your cityscapes. Of course I had to try this out with some of my favourite Public Housing estates here in Singapore, starting with Toa Payoh.

The T-shaped block right in front, Block 68, is a rental only block that was built in 1966, the year the first blocks of flats were completed in Toa Payoh. It was also the subject of my previous three posts so do check those out too!
