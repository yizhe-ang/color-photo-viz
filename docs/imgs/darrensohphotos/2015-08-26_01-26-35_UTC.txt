One of two remaining #dragon #playground s left in #Singapore and the only one with its original sandpit still in place. This #latergram image was made 2.5 years ago when the block of #flats you see in the image was still standing. Situated at #toapayoh lor 6, the block was demolished about a year after. #SERS #sgmemory #sgbuilding #sglandscape #sgheartlands #sgarchitecture #archdaily #archivingsg #architecture #architecturalphotography #architecturalphotographer #igsg
