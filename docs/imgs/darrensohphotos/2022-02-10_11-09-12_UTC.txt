We were invited by @capitaland yesterday for a preview of #capitaspring and initially thought it was going to be a complete washout thanks to the storm. 

However, instead of sunshine and blue skies, we got to witness dramatic cloudscapes from 280m high up on the roof of the tower, which joins UOB Plaza 1, One Raffles Place and Republic Plaza as the second tallest buildings in all of Singapore. The sky garden on the roof of CapitaSpring is set to open to the public in Q2 this year, with no charges whatsoever!

I spent a wet wet afternoon with @yaisyusman @yafiqyusman @yk and @ksy.yuan but we got some amazing views of a Singapore we don't see every day. 

This is the view straight to the junction of Orchard and Scotts Road (which you cannot see but that tall tower poking through the clouds is @ion_orchard another CapitaLand development that happens to be located at that junction.
