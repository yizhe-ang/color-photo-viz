This image of #zahahadid @zaha_hadid 's #dleedon in #singapore was made four years ago when the #condominium was under #construction I remember the builder telling me it was one of the tougher projects they have encountered because instead of using some form of cladding for the #facade the curves had to be cast in #concrete instead and then joined. #architecturephotography #sgarchitecture #archilovers #architecturesg #archdaily #archi #architect #architecture #ripzahahadid
