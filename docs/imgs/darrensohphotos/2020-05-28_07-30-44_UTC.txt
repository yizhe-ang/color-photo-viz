Because we are still in the circuit breaker and should not be deliberately out photographing, I am going into my archives to share some fun facts about our public housing estates here in Singapore for my next few posts.

Here are blocks 20, 21 and 22 Jalan Tenteram. Also known as St. Michael's Estate, this part of Whampoa / Balestier contains some of the very first HDB flats in Singapore completed in 1961 and 1962, 1-2 years after the HDB was formed.

The area was formerly home to a large Singapore Improvement Trust (SIT) estate comprising both terrace houses and 9 storey flats. 
Today the high rise portion of the SIT estate has been completely demolished and what is left are terrace houses built by the SIT that are now under HDB jurisdiction.

In addition to the SIT terrace houses, other buildings in the area from the early 1960s and before are 6 blocks of 3-room flats and these 3 blocks which consist ONLY of 2-room flats.

There are 320 2-room flats in blocks 20 and 21 each and 118 2-room flats in block 22 for a total of 758 flats.

Back in 1962, you could rent one of these 2-Room flat at SGD 40 / month.
