The @singaporeartmuseum opened its doors in 1996 in what was formerly the @stjosephsinstitution building and and as a young photographer starting my practice about the same time, SAM, through its programming and community, offered my peers and I many opportunities. In 2008, I had the privilege to photograph the architecture of SAM for the National Heritage Board, and it is with three of those images that I would like to remember SAM before it goes for an extensive renovation and restoration soon. .
