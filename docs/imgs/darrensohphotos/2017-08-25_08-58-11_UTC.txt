I was looking through my archives last night and came across this #panorama I made of the #singapore #skyline made in #2008 nearly a decade ago. If you are familiar with this city like I am, you will realise that some of the #buildings no longer exist and indeed there are some which exist today that did not then. A very notable example is #ionorchard which wasn't built yet back then but is now the tallest structure in #orchardroad (It would take up the space next to the #pagoda shaped #marriot @singaporemarriott ) which is quite prominent in this image. #archivingsg #archdaily #architecture #architecturesg #architecturephotography #architecturelovers #landscape #landscapesg #landscapelovers #landscapephotography #cityscape #cityscapephotography #sgcity #sgcityscape 001/003
