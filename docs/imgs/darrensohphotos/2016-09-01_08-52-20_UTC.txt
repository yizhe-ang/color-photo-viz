Yesterday was the final day of the #lunar7thmonth where some believe the souls of the departed roam our plane for a month. I photographed this in #limchukang #cemetery as some of the living leave lights to guide the departed as they make their way back home to the #netherworld #sglandscape #landscapesg #landscape #landscapephotography #nocturnal #nightphotography #singapore #sonya7rii #sonyalphaprofessionals
